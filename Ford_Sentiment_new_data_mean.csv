Ford F-Series remains top-selling truck; new Lightning EV ...,03-Jan-23,Yahoo. Advertisement. Yahoo Finance. Ford F-Series remains top ... In fact  Ford hasn't made corporate clones of its F-Series pickup since 2002...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-series-remains-top-selling-truck-new-lightning-ev-reportedly-coming-in-2025-233405096.html,"It’s the automotive equivalent of the annual return of the swallows of Capistrano.
For the 46th consecutive year, Ford (F) says its F-Series pick-ups will be the top selling truck in America for 2022.
Though the official Ford sales data doesn’t come out until January 5, the Dearborn-based automaker is fairly positive that the over 640,000 F-Series trucks sold will top rivals including GM, Toyota, and Stellantis’ Ram brand, the company said in a statement.
Now if GM combined sales of its Chevrolet Silverado and corporate twin GMC Sierra pickups, it would be the top selling truck ""platform: (shared engineering and production) in America, with 768,689 sold last year (with Ford F-Series at 726,004 last year). But that’s not how it works, there’s only one F-series. In fact Ford hasn’t made corporate clones of its F-Series pickup since 2002 (Remember the Lincoln Blackwood?).
Those 640,000+ trucks sold would also make the F-Series the best-selling overall vehicle in America for the 41st consecutive year. Ford says if you lined up every Ford pick-up sold last year it would stretch 2,400 miles, or longer than the driving distance from Los Angeles to Detroit.

Ford will also likely have sold around 15K or so F-150 Lightning pickups in 2022 — its first year on sale — and which also brings us to another bit of Ford news.
In a leaked report to clients, automotive production research firm AutoForecast Solutions (AFS) predicted the 2nd-gen Ford F-150 Lightnings will go into production starting on August 18, 2025. The report states that the 2nd-gen and 1st-gen Lightnings will be jointly in production for around 4 months before Ford fully transitions to the 2nd-gen platform, which will be the electric only TE1 platform. The current Lightning platform is shared with the regular gas-powered F-150.
Sam Fiorani, AFS VP of global vehicle forecasting, had this to say about the Lightning in a phone interview with Yahoo Finance:
“The most recent info we have shows that the nex-gen F-series Lightning will go into production in August 2025. In the development of a new vehicle, dates change all the time, but current planning has that date in mind,” Fiorani said.
Fiorani noted that AFS tracks production of vehicles in about 60 countries around the world, so “making sure that these dates are accurate allows our clients — both suppliers and manufacturers — to make sure they know when the market is changing.”
Ford may reveal more about its electric plans on February 2, when the company reports Q4 earnings. It will also be the last time Ford will combine results of its gas-powered and electric business lines in its quarterly earnings, as the company plans to break out the division results starting in 2023.

15 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals,02-Jan-23,Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47. Ford Motor  Company (NYSE:F) designs manufactures markets and services a range of  Ford trucks...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-widely-held-stocks-201246806.html,"In this article, we discuss the 15 most widely held stocks by individuals.

Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year, the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months. 
It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research, it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.
However, the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market. 
Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors, who have become an important market force in recent years, are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months.

“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter.

12. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66     
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. Chevron’s Texaco Exploration & Production reported that total oil and gas production in January 2022 was 5,09.62 boe/d. The oil production in 2022 stood at 3,682.74 bd.

“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”
10. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  
Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) a technology and automotive company, develops electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

On December 7, GameStop posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $0.31, missing the market estimates by $0.03.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) with 2 million shares worth more than $252 million. 
In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Bireme Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“Amazingly, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap, exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak, gross margins are down 1500 bps, and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high).
Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability, making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m, markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead, we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model, utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”
8. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18  
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) engages in the theatrical exhibition business. On December 22, AMC Entertainment announced a flotation of financial transactions.

(NYSE:NIO) stock and lowered the price target to $10.40 from $12.30, highlighting that the company's fourth-quarter deliveries are being delayed by ongoing COVID issues, which led to a reduction in delivery guidance.  
At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $518.9 million in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), compared to 25 in the preceding quarter worth $873.9 million. 
In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“At the beginning of April, the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”
6. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47

In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Leaven Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”

The...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-highest-paid-athletes-time-172958184.html,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 highest paid athletes of all time. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 highest paid athletes of all time.
Sports has been a big deal ever since civilization existed, with sportsmen held on a pedestal and revered throughout history. And while fame was a given to successful athletes, riches were much less certain, though in some cases, athletes were immensely rich. One of the most idolized athletes in ancient history was a Roman chariot racer Gaius Appuleius Diocles, who earned nearly 36 million sesterces in his career, which would be worth over $15 billion today and no athlete has come close to similar earnings since. There are several sports that are popular throughout the world, with football (or soccer for the U.S.) easily being the most popular sport in the world. The two biggest football stars in the world and perhaps history not to mention among the highest paid athletes of all-time, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, are also the two most-followed people on Instagram, with a total of 940 million followers between the two. Other popular sports, with some whose popularity is mainly centered in the U.S., include golf, American football, basketball and baseball.
25 highest paid athletes of all time
CristinaMuraca / Shutterstock.com
Before the 1980s, while some athletes were earning a solid salary, most actually had day jobs for stable income even if they were playing in front of tens of thousands of people. While massive players such as baseball legend Babe Ruth earned $80,000 per year in the 1930s, that only comes out to $1 million per year adjusted for inflation today, which even less coveted players in the top leagues would scoff at. This all changed when televisions became a common household item, extending the reach of sports to millions of people worldwide which led to lucrative broadcasting TV rights and earned athletes massive contracts. In 1984, the highest earning athlete in the world was Magic Johnson, who of course played for the NBA and earned $2.5 million a year. Meanwhile the highest salaries in MLB and the NFL were $2 million and $1.1 million respectively. Meanwhile, the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world by far, was paying its players an average of £50,000 per year only.
When TV rights deals exploded, so did the salaries of players. The English Premier League saw the Division 1 clubs break away from the old Football League to take advantage of TV rights from Sky, which is owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Now, the league's accumulated TV rights deals are worth well over £3 billion per year and a potential TV audience of over 4.7 billion people which has enriched clubs within the league and allowed them to pay incredible amounts of money in terms of wages. While it seems more closed off to the working class, there are incredible stories in the Premier League such as Jamie Vardy, who was a factory worker initially and started playing for a club which paid him £30 per match. Later on, he played for Leicester City Football Club, and was the driving force behind the team winning the Premier League in what is considered the biggest sporting shock in history. Of course, Vardy earned millions along the way and is still playing for the same club.
Nowadays, athlete's earnings aren't just from their sports contracts as endorsements and sponsorships are a big part of their wealth. Major companies such as NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Adidas and Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) all sponsor many athletes in addition to various other companies, while these athletes also advertise several different products, earning millions for being the face of different brands. The highest paid athletes of all-time earn hundreds of millions of dollars, with seven of them having earned over $1 billion unadjusted for inflation while 12 athletes have earned over $1 billion adjusted for inflation. But before we talk about the highest earning athletes of all-time, let's talk about the highest earning athletes in 2022.
Forbes carries out an annual ranking of the highest earning sports stars in the world, who earned over $130 million in the year of which $75 million were on-field while $55 million were earned from off-field endeavors. Lebron James came second in the list with $121 million though two-thirds of his income was from off-field endeavors. The top 10 alone earned $990 million in a single year which shows how earnings for athletes are continuing to increase and there is no indication that this will slow down, regardless of an emerging recession which is threatening the livelihoods of regular people. Even during the pandemic, while many players took pay cuts to ease burdens on their clubs as games were cancelled and they played to empty stadiums, it was no big deal for people who earned a few million dollars instead of several million dollars.
While it's easy to consider which athlete is earning the most right now, it is harder to determine the highest-earning athletes of all time. While Forbes has conducted research on this, this was last done in 2017 and in the ensuing 5 years, the list has changed significantly with current players earning a lot more. This is why we consulted research by Sportico which determined the highest-earning athletes of all time adjusted for inflation. So, let's take a look at the best of the best in the world of sports, not to mention the richest, starting with number 25:
25. Derek Jeter
Total earnings adjusted for inflation (in millions): $555
One of only two baseball players among the highest paid athletes of all time, Derek Jeter played for the New York Yankees for the entirety of his MLB career.

24. Peyton Manning

20. Lewis Hamilton
Total earnings adjusted for inflation (in millions): $620

Timken has been benefiting from growth across most end-market sectors, led by industrial distribution and off-highway, and the impact of higher pricing.
In the third quarter of 2022, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. The bottom line increased 29% year over year. Total revenues in the quarter were $1,136 million, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,091 million.
To reflect the third-quarter results, Timken raised the adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 to $5.80-$5.95 from the previously stated $5.50-$5.80. For 2022, it expects total revenue growth of 9% from the 2021 reported level.
Price Performance
In the past year, shares of Timken have gained 3.6% against the industry’s fall of 8.2%.

2022 U.S. Auto Sales Fall to a Decade Low,09-Jan-23,While Stellantis sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) TM and HMC carry a  Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile General Motors and Ford are currently  Ranked #4 (Sell)...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-u-auto-sales-fall-130501245.html,"Last year, sales of light vehicles in the United States dropped to their lowest level since 2012 amid severe supply chain snarls and tight inventories. Per the Automotive News, U.S. light-vehicle sales in 2022 totaled 13.4 million units. The data takes into account the automakers that have released their sales data so far, barring a few like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover that are set to report this week. In 2021, sales of U.S. light vehicles came in at 14.9 million units approximately.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for December 2022 was 13.59 million, the lowest level since August. To put it in perspective, prior to COVID, SAAR had topped 17 million vehicles for five straight years from 2015 to 2019. While the global pandemic rattled the auto market in 2020, the supply deficit was the number one challenge in 2021. Just when industry watchdogs and auto giants were predicting the chip deficit to gradually start easing out from mid-2022, the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered the second round of global microchip shortage. The war created ripple effects in the automotive supply chain and exacerbated the chip famine as raw materials got difficult to come by. While the demand for cars remained strong, automakers could not produce enough cars. Parts shortage choked supplies and low stockpiles impacted sales.New vehicle inventory in the United States, especially in the first half of 2022, was mostly running below 1 million units. While inventories started improving in the back half of the year, they are still way below the pre-pandemic levels.
Before we discuss whether the road is likely to be any smoother this year, here’s a rundown of the 2022 U.S. sales report of auto bigwigs, including General Motors GM, Ford F, Stellantis STLA, Toyota TM, Honda HMC and others.
A Glance Through the Sales Numbers
General Motors reclaimed the U.S. auto sales crown from Toyota in 2022. The U.S. legacy automaker sold more than 2.25 million units last year, up 2.5%. While full-year sales across its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands rose 13.9%, 5.6% and 7.3%, respectively, that of Buick tailed off 42.4% on a yearly basis.
In fact, General Motors was the only major auto giant, which reported a year-over-year increase in sales last year (apart from the electric vehicle [EV] king Tesla).
Japan’s auto giant Toyota came in second, delivering more than 2.1 million units last year. Sales contracted 9.6% from 2021 when TM defeated GM as the top-selling automaker in the United States. While sales of the namesake brand Toyota were down 8.8%, the Lexus division witnessed sales decline of 15% year over year. Importantly, RAV4 was U.S.’ best-selling SUV for the seventh straight year in 2022.
GM’s close peer, Ford, sold more than 1.86 million units in 2022, inching down 2.2% year over year. While sales of cars and trucks declined 29.4% and 5.5%, respectively, SUV sales registered 4.1% growth. Importantly, F-Series maintained its position as America’s best-selling truck for 46 straight years.
TM’s close peer Honda saw 2022 U.S. sales plunge 32.9% year over year to 983,507 units (with truck sales comprising 66.6% of the total volumes). Sales of the namesake brand and Acura dropped 28% and 39.2%, respectively. CR-V remained the best-selling vehicle of the firm for the 10th straight year in 2022.
Stellantis’ 2022 sales slid 13% to 1.54 million units, with Jeep, RAM, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Alpha Romeo brands recording 12%, 16%, 2%, 12%, 61% and 30% fall in volumes, respectively. Sales at two of its major brands Jeep and RAM fell for the sixth straight quarter ending Dec 31, 2022.
While Stellantis sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), TM and HMC carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford are currently Ranked #4 (Sell) and #5 (Strong Sell).
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
EV Sales Remain the Bright Spot
While the overall U.S. vehicle sales were down year over year in 2022, EV sales managed to maintain momentum. More than 807,000 EVs were sold last year in the United States. It accounted for 5.8% of total vehicle sales, up from 3.2% in 2021. Tesla was the clear winner and Ford emerged as the second largest maker of green vehicles, with full-year sales hitting a record 61,575 units, rocketing 126% year over year. Hyundai Motor was a close third, selling 58,028 EVs in 2022.
The EV race is only expected to get fiercer in 2023, as many new models are expected to be rolled out, including Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 6 and General Motors’ Silverado EV among others. Cox Automotive expects EV sales to cross one million units in the United States for the first time this year.
Inventory Improving
Inventory levels in December came in more than one million units for the third consecutive month, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.  Per TrueCar, the total new light-vehicle inventory, including fleet and commercial vehicles, totaled 1.8 million last month, up from 1.1 million recorded in December 2021.
Cox Automotive notified that brands like Buick, RAM, Ford, Jeep, Volvo, Infiniti, Jaguar, Audi, Dodge and Lincoln Chrysler recorded the highest stockpiles last month. Meanwhile, brands including Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Subaru, Land Rover, Kia, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Acura logged the lowest inventory levels.
Affordability is the Pressing Concern for 2023
Just when new vehicles seem to be becoming more widely available, it’s to be seen if Americans wish to continue to splurge on these high-ticket items in the face of rising interest rates and recession worries.
To rein in the stubborn inflation, Fed became ultra-aggressive, cranking up borrowing rates repeatedly in 2022. Increasing costs of vehicle financing are making monthly payments less affordable for less-affluent and subprime consumers. With borrowing getting expensive and threats of a recession looming large, consumers are gradually starting to get apprehensive on buying cars. Resultantly, vehicle sales forecasts are getting slashed and automakers’ pressing concern is now shifting from inventory challenges to rising interest rates, which may erode demand with economic downturn around the corner. It's yet to be seen if automakers resort to better incentives, sweeter financing deals and discounts to hold up demand if customers get unwilling to shell more for these discretionary items.
Projections for U.S. light vehicle sales for 2023 sales range from 14.1 million to 15 million units. Well, that’s above this year but much below the pre-pandemic years. Edmunds estimates 14.8 million cars and trucks to be sold in the United States in 2023, well below the sales that automakers were registering in the previous decade.
Per a senior economist at Cox Automotive, much of the pent-up demand from the limited supply is gradually disappearing as high interest rates eat away vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase. So, will the supply crunch morph into a demand slowdown in 2023? Quite likely.

iris-recognition-market-size.jpg
Dublin, Jan. 10, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Global Iris Recognition Market Size, Share & Industry Trends Analysis Report By Application, By Product (Scanners, Smartphones, Personal Computers/Laptops, Tablets & Notebooks), By Component, By Vertical, By Regional Outlook and Forecast, 2022 - 2028"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Iris Recognition Market size is expected to reach $8.9 billion by 2028, rising at a market growth of 15.6% CAGR during the forecast period.

Iris recognition is a precise and effective technology for protecting information, people, and other sensitive things. Due to its usage in consumer electronics devices like PCs and laptops, iris recognition is becoming more popular. The use of iris recognition technology in laptops has raised general awareness of its convenience and dependability.

Although it is 10 times more expensive than fingerprint scanner technology, iris recognition is 10 times more secure. As a result, the iris recognition market has begun to migrate to reduce costs, and it is anticipated that it will soon be a technology for identity management. The distinctive patterns in people's irises - the colourful circles in their eyes - are measured via iris scanning.

To detect distinctive patterns undetectable to the human eye, biometric iris recognition scanners illuminate the iris with invisible infrared light. Eyelids, Eyelashes, and specular reflections that generally cover some of the iris are detected and excluded by iris scanners. The result is a collection of pixels that only include the iris.

The bit pattern encodes the data in the iris is then extracted by analysing the pattern of the lines and colours in the eye. This bit pattern is digitalized and checked against templates that are kept in a database for identification or verification (one-to-one template matching) (one-to-many template matching).

Iris scanners gather over 240 biometric characteristics, which are distinctive to each eye. The data is subsequently converted into a digital format by the scanners. This digital database contains the numeric representation of the data that was taken from the iris image.

COVID-19 Impact Analysis

Iris and periocular recognition could become more widely used due to biometrics research sparked by COVID-19. The adoption of COVID-19 has fostered a move from touch-based to contactless technology, which has resulted in a considerable loss for fingerprint recognition methods.
The new standard of touchless recognition systems has been established since contact-based technology presents a significant risk to sanitary safety. With this change in mind, iris recognition is thought to be the greatest option by far. Therefore, the COVID-19 has a favourable effect on the market for iris recognition.

Market Growth Factors
Governmental agencies are using iris recognition technology more often for identification and authentication.

One of the first industries to use iris recognition technology, the government sector creates significant demand for its goods and services. This is one of the main drivers of the iris recognition market's expansion. Iris recognition technology is used by government departments, agencies, and organisations worldwide for identification and authentication.
For instance, the Next Generation Identification (NGI) systems, and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) were developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in collaboration with local, state, tribal, and federal authorities. As a trustworthy method of identification, these systems use iris recognition.

Adoption Of Biometric Technologies In The Defence And Automobile Industries

Touchless biometric products are anticipated to have strong demand in the automotive industry in the upcoming years. User/driver authentication, in-cabin personalisation, in-car payment, and intra-vehicle network encryption are just a few of the uses for scanning the vein, face, iris, or finger.
Numerous automotive behemoths, including Ford Motor Company (US), Audi AG, and BMW AG, are developing touchless biometric systems for automobile use. In addition, the car industry is embracing iris-based biometric systems because of their high accuracy, non-contact characteristics, and ability to operate in low light.

Market Restraining Factors
Competition With Other Biometric Technologies

There are numerous biometric technologies on the market, including voice recognition, vascular recognition, face recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. The market acceptability of various technologies varies depending on their benefits and drawbacks. Face and fingerprint recognition technologies are fierce competitors for iris recognition technology. Its high price is one of the main causes of this. Iris scanners cost more than face and fingerprint detection systems, which are their alternatives.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Ford Motor with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
Ford Motor's Improving Profits
Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that Ford Motor's EPS went from US$0.72 to US$2.24 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company.
It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Not all of Ford Motor's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. The good news is that Ford Motor is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.2 percentage points to 7.0%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.
The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.

In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Ford Motor's forecast profits?
Are Ford Motor Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
Since Ford Motor has a market capitalisation of US$51b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$675m. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.
Is Ford Motor Worth Keeping An Eye On?
Ford Motor's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Ford Motor for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.

Ford (F) Q4 Earnings Coming Up: Credit Unit to Play Spoiler?,20-Jan-23,Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote. Q3 ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us · Terms...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-q4-earnings-coming-121112678.html,"Ford F is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 59 cents a share. The bottom-line projection implies year-over-year growth of 127%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s fourth-quarter earnings per share has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.
The U.S. auto biggie missed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter amid lower-than-expected profits in its North America segment and plummeting revenues and widening pretax loss in the China unit. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford surpassed earnings estimates once and missed on the other three occasions, the average surprise being 3.21%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote
Q3 Highlights
Ford’s third-quarter adjusted earnings came in at 30 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. The bottom line declined 41.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. The company’s consolidated third-quarter revenues came in at $39.4 billion, rising 10% year over year.Revenues from the Automotive segment increased 12% to $37.2 billion but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.6 billion.
Ford reported an adjusted free cash flow of $3,601 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with $20.5 billion on Dec 31, 2021. The automotive long-term debt increased to $19,073 million from $17,200 million as of the end of 2021.
Things to Note Ahead of Q4 Release
Ford’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to have been aided by a projected increase in total wholesale units. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total wholesale shipments worldwide is pegged at 1,209,000 units, indicating an increase from 1,105,000 units in the year-ago period. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter revenues from automotive sales is $39,402 million, implying an uptick from $35,300 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EBIT from the segment is pegged at $3,631 million, implying growth from $1,638 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The consensus mark for revenues from Ford Credit is pegged at $2,235 million, implying a decrease from $2,373 million. The consensus mark for adjusted EBIT from the segment is $338 million, suggesting a fall from $1,055 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Profits from Ford Credit will likely be lower as auction values are expected to have been moderated by the nonrecurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.
The consensus mark for revenues from Ford Mobility is pegged at $42.9 million, implying a decline from $48 million. The consensus mark for loss before interest and taxes from the segment is $222 million.
While stronger year-over-year results from the firm’s Automotive segment bode well, poor performances from Ford Credit and Mobility units are likely to have played spoilsports. Further, massive spending on modernization, including connectivity, IT and new product launches, are expected to have limited earnings to some extent.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ford for the to-be-reported quarter, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Earnings ESP: Ford has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Stocks With the Favorable Combination
While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Ford, here are a couple of players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:
Lear LEA will release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lear’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.53 per share and $5.26 billion, respectively. LEA surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 18%.
Harley-Davidson HOG is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results by mid-February. The company has an Earnings ESP of +300.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Harley-Davidson’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 3 cents per share and $880.5 million, respectively. HOG surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 43.3%.

Global automotive engine market - Segmentation assessment

Segment overview
Technavio has segmented the market based on type (in-line engine, V-type engine, and flat engine) and fuel type (gasoline and diesel engine).
The gasoline segment will grow at a significant rate during the forecast period. Passenger cars generally use gasoline-powered engines, as they emit fewer pollutants, create less vibration and noise, and are lightweight. Engine downsizing is another major factor propelling the demand for gasoline engines, which reduces the size of a gasoline engine when compared to a diesel engine. In addition, diesel-powered cars are more expensive than gasoline-powered passenger cars. These factors will fuel the growth of the market during the forecast period.
Geography overview
Based on geography, the global automotive engine market is segmented into APAC, North America, Europe, South America, and Middle East and Africa. The report provides actionable insights and estimates the contribution of all regions to the growth of the global automotive engine market.
APAC is estimated to account for 38% of the growth of the global market during the forecast period. China and India have the largest share of the automotive engine market in APAC in terms of production volume due to the presence of a large automotive production base. During the forecast period, low-cost manufacturers are expected to enter the market in APAC, especially in China, owing to the reduction in the prices of components and the availability of stable and advanced systems.

11 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks According to Hedge Funds,20-Jan-23,... Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and AutoNation Inc. (NYSE:AN).  ADVERTISEMENT ... The analyst believes that the financial performance at  Sonic Automotive Inc.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-undervalued-auto-stocks-153337404.html,"In this article, we discuss 11 most undervalued auto stocks according to hedge funds.

The automotive industry has been plagued by multiple problems apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the constrained Asia Pacific backdrop and the war in Ukraine. The shortages in microchips and labor are also impacting every level of the automotive supply chain. However, the development of electric vehicles is a significant global trend, with particular focus on improving battery performance and expanding charging infrastructure. This results in increased research and development by vehicle manufacturers, who are continuing to invest in EV technology despite other challenges they may be facing. 
The fast pace of development in the EV industry indicates that manufacturers have an optimistic outlook about the future of EVs. New advancements are regularly being made, bringing the industry closer to the concept of ""Vehicles 2.0"". Larry Keyler, Partner and Global Automotive Leader at RSM US, said on January 18: 
“The development of autonomous vehicle technology has slowed down somewhat, as manufacturers redirect and refocus on the refinement of the electric vehicle. These are certainly being driven by the regulatory landscape, which at the moment is accelerating a path to wide-scale EV adoption. Governments in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are all implementing their own initiatives, not to mention the UN, and auto makers are under pressure to deliver”. 
However, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an investor note in December 2022: 
“There is active demand destruction in the industry, given inflation, interest rates, and energy costs − but so far, this has mostly impacted the backlog.”

On January 12, Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ALSN) announced that it has partnered with Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) to carry out testing of its Class 8 battery-electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle at Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ALSN)’s state-of-the-art Vehicle Electrification + Environmental Test (VE+ET) Center. At the facility, Allison imitates real world applications and climate conditions, allowing original equipment manufacturers to lower product development and validation timelines, in order to bring innovative technology and vehicle systems to market quicker and more effectively.

Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ALSN) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:
“Allison Transmission is a niche industrial company with roughly 80% market share in truck transmissions. Its products provide the company’s customers with critical advantages, including fuel economy, reduced emissions, reliability and total-cost-of ownership. The importance of Allison Transmission’s products and its dominant market position have historically given it strong pricing power. Yet, in the year leading up to our purchase, the company’s shares underperformed peers by more than 40 percentage points. Although we believe the company’s fundamentals are still as strong, if not better, than its peers, investors have worried about how commercial vehicle electrification will affect Allison Transmission’s long-term business. We believe that the company’s investments in next-generation products will enable it to maintain its position as an industry leader, even as technologies change. Furthermore, we believe that our investment carries limited downside risk because Allison Transmission’s shares sell at 10x free cash flow, which ascribes almost no value to the future. In addition, the company’s management team diligently returns capital to shareholders.”
7. Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30
P/E Ratio as of January 19: 5.55
Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

On October 6, JPMorgan analyst Rajat Gupta upgraded Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) to Overweight from Neutral with a $210 price target. The analyst noted that the setup for franchise auto dealers into Q3 earnings is the most negative he has encountered since the pandemic. He upgraded Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments Small Cap Value Strategy has to say about Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:
“We also initiated a new position in Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI), in the consumer discretionary sector. Group 1 Automotive is one of the leading auto dealership groups in the U.S. and the U.K. Through our analysis, we believe the current stock price already discounts a considerable decline in revenue and profits due to concerns about elevated used car prices and high gross margins per unit. However, we believe this does not reflect the underlying strength of the company’s diversified business line and flexible cost structure. Ultimately, we believe the company will prove more durable than the market expects and be a long-term value creator for the portfolio.”

With substantial exposure to the automotive industry through other portfolio holdings, we elected to consolidate our exposure within those higher-conviction holdings.”

The State that Wants to Ban Electric Vehicles,20-Jan-23,... Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) to Toyota  Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) — would manufacture vehicles to comply with  California's energy...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-wants-ban-electric-vehicles-141539973.html,"A group of lawmakers in Wyoming has introduced a bill to ban sales of electric vehicles in the state by 2035, claiming the move will boost the state’s oil and gas industry while ensuring its ability to trade with other states.
Wyoming’s proposed phaseout of electric vehicles (EVs) would be timed for 2035 — the same year that California has pledged to phase out gas-powered cars. The proposal is mostly being viewed as a tongue-in-cheek response to progressive overreach in California.
Even if Wyoming manages to stamp out the EV revolution within its borders, it would be little consolation to the anti-EV lawmakers. California has a population over 52 times greater than Wyoming’s, and in late 2022, the Golden State surpassed Germany as the world’s fourth-largest economy.

If California were a country, only three nations would have a higher gross domestic product. They are, in order, the remaining 49 U.S. states, China and Japan. France, Italy, Brazil and the United Kingdom all have smaller economies than the $3.63 trillion in economic activity California achieved in 2022.
This dynamic is consequential to the clean energy transition because, in many ways, as California goes, so goes the nation. For example, the Trump administration sued California over its clean energy standards in 2018 because it knew that the biggest car manufacturers — from Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) to Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) — would manufacture vehicles to comply with California’s energy regulations over the looser ones of the Trump White House rather than forgo such a massive market.
Of course, President Joe Biden’s rise to the White House made that legal conflict moot. Today, the White House and California’s state government are working in tandem to hasten the transition to electric vehicles — including the federal initiative to spend $7.5 billion building America’s first-ever national network of EV charging stations.
But even this historic network of chargers pales in comparison to the $369 billion the federal government is spending to boost solar, wind, thermal and new battery technologies. This $369 billion package is not just the largest single sum the U.S. government has ever spent to boost clean energy, it’s the largest by far. Among numerous clean energy carveouts, it allows taxpayers to claim a 30% deduction on solar installation costs on their homes or businesses through 2032.
That’s great news for YouSolar, a startup company that’s helping customers transition to the electric grid. It’s doing so with the help of a nano-grid technology that delivers clean, reliable power with next to no involvement from the traditional energy grid. And given what you’ve just read on California’s vow to transition to clean energy, you won’t be surprised to learn that the company is already seeing more demand in Northern California than it can keep up with.

Global mild hybrid vehicles market - Segmentation assessment
Segment overview
Technavio has segmented the market based on type (passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle) and capacity (48V and above and less than 48V).
The passenger vehicles segment will grow at a significant rate during the forecast period. The passenger vehicles segment dominates the automotive industry, which is driving the growth of this segment. The implementation of stringent emission and fuel economy norms and government incentives that promote the purchase and adoption of mild hybrid vehicles are also driving the segment's growth. Mild hybrid vehicles are more fuel-efficient than traditional passenger vehicles, as they use electricity from automotive batteries for start-stop functions or to attain cruising speeds. Hence, the segment is projected to grow rapidly throughout the forecast period.
Geography overview
Based on geography, the global mild hybrid vehicles market is segmented into APAC, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and South America. The report provides actionable insights and estimates the contribution of all regions to the growth of the global mild hybrid vehicles market.
APAC is estimated to account for 46% of the growth of the global market during the forecast period. China, India, South Korea, and Japan are leaders in automobile sales and manufacturing. Developments in infrastructure and industrialization have led to significant demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in APAC. The discretionary income of people has grown in APAC, as the economic conditions of nations such as China and Japan have improved. This, in turn, has increased automobile sales. Such factors will drive the market's growth during the forecast period in APAC.

Global mild hybrid vehicles market – Market dynamics
Leading drivers - Stringent emission control regulations are driving the market growth. Concerns about environmental pollution have led to strict emissions regulations in the US and European countries. The US EPA has revised its vehicle emissions regulations. This is fueling the growth of the global mild hybrid vehicle market. Growing consumer awareness and strict emission regulations are compelling automotive OEMs to produce light hybrid and electric vehicles that emit fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline and diesel vehicles. These factors will drive the market's growth during the forecast period.
Key trends - Recent developments are a key trend in the market. In 2021, General Motors launched its Buick GL8 Classic with a 48V mild hybrid powertrain in China. In 2020, Chevrolet launched five new Orlando variants in China, which feature 48V mild hybrid technology. As of 2021, Nissan was working on a mild-mild hybrid GT-R model, which would have a 48-volt mild-mild hybrid system. In 2021, Mercedes-Benz unveiled two models of diesel mild hybrids, namely GLE and GLE Coupe. Such developments will increase the demand for mild hybrid vehicles during the forecast period.
Major challenges – The rising demand for BEVs and FCEVs is challenging the market's growth. The demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is increasing. Automakers such as Tesla Inc. (USA), and Volkswagen AG (Germany) are focusing on the development of BEVs. In addition, governments are implementing measures and encouraging the use of fuel-cell vehicles in the transportation sector, which will increase the demand for fuel cells in the automotive and transportation industries. Such factors are expected to limit the growth of the market during the forecast period.

Amid a disastrous 2022 some analysts and market pundits are predicting a market rebound in late 2023 or 2024. Historically, market declines have given a golden opportunity for investors to pile into stocks before they rebound to higher valuations. As inflation begins to show signs of cooling in the US, the Federal Reserve might begin to ease monetary policy in 2023 and eventually halt rate hikes. In a Bloomberg survey, about 70% of the top global investors said they expected stocks to rise in 2023.
However, there seems to be a consensus among market analysts that we are set to face a recession this year. A Bloomberg Economics model shows a 100% probability of recession starting by August 2023, and some market experts believe the market slowdown would not cause central banks to take any unexpected action. The Bloomberg report quoted Deutsche Bank Private Bank’s global chief investment officer Christian Nolting, who thinks that policymakers in the US and Europe are now “resigned” to weaker economic growth in 2023. The analyst said that recession might be short but “will not be painless.”
Despite the possible market situation in 2023 or beyond, the fact remains that successful investors always ignore short-term volatility when investing and pile into solid stocks when they are trading at lower prices. Sooner or later the stock market is expected to turn the corner. When it does, only those investors would come out as winners who had invested when things were bad.
JPMorgan said in a latest report that P/E ratios are much closer to fair value than they have been in recent years. This is one of the biggest benefits of the latest market correction. Talking about the US stock market, JPMorgan said that its expected return in 2023 from US equities increased from 4.1% to 7.9% in U.S. dollar terms. The firm noted that in its last year’s forecast, valuations were a significant headwind. But current earnings multiples give a much better starting point.

BMW Tries To Accelerate Solid-State Batteries Production ...,20-Jan-23,Solid Power has development agreements with both BMW and Ford Motor Co  (NYSE ... Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos ·  Yahoo Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bmw-tries-accelerate-solid-state-150446870.html,"Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC: BMWYY) expanded its partnership with Solid Power, Inc (NASDAQ: SLDP) for conducting complementary cell development and manufacturing activities.
Now BMW can establish an ASSB prototype line in its Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich.
BMW will begin producing cells in the first half of this year to develop battery cells large enough to test in a vehicle before 2025, Bloomberg reports citing Peter Lamp, BMW's head of battery R&D, in an interview.
Solid Power has development agreements with both BMW and Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and could win automotive supply contracts on goal accomplishment.
""We have good teams on the Solid Power side, on the BMW side,"" Lamp said. ""If we move forward separately, it's not the same speed as if we join forces.""
Solid Power went public via a reverse merger in 2021. Co-founder Doug Campbell stepped down as CEO in November. Chair David Jansen served as interim CEO while it searched for a permanent replacement.
In 2022, BMW invested $1.7 billion in its U.S. operations under its electromobility plan.
The investment includes $1 billion to prepare for the production of electric vehicles at the company's existing U.S. manufacturing facility in Plant Spartanburg, South Carolina and $700 million to build a new high-voltage battery assembly facility nearby Woodruff, South Carolina.
The solid-state battery market reached $630.5 million in 2021 and will likely grow at a CAGR of 36.3% to reach $10.2 billion in 2030, courtesy of global demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs).
Price Action: SLDP shares traded higher by 6.25% at $2.97 on the last check Friday.

Here's Why You Should Retain DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY ...,19-Jan-23,Apart from this the company will also introduce multiple new motor systems  in the upcoming months. ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal  Finance · Crypto...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-dentsply-sirona-125312845.html,"DENTSPLY SIRONA XRAY is well-poised for growth on a robust product portfolio and continued focus on research and development. However, forex remains a headwind.
Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 30.8% compared with the industry's decline of 2% in the past year. The S&P 500 Index has lost 12.5% in the same time frame.
The company, with a market capitalization of $7.91 billion, is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables, dental laboratory products, dental specialty products and consumable medical device products. It anticipates its earnings to improve 3.9% over the next five years.

What's Favoring the Stock?
DENTSPLY's introduction of PrimeScan, a digital impression scanner, and Primemill, among its other major products, has been driving the company's top line over the past couple of years. It bolstered the consumable areas with Surefil one, Palodent 360 and the digital denture program. The company's Astra EV Implant has been gaining momentum as well.
The company launched Primeprint, a medical-grade, highly automated 3D printer, in 2022 to bolster dentists’ workflows and practice efficiency. Apart from being an easy-to-use device, this 3D printer enables dentists to delegate tasks related to 3D printing to their staff. Primeprint provides complete integration with the CEREC system and enables dentists to produce things like night guards, surgical guides and full-scale models in a quick and inexpensive manner.
In 2021, the company launched ProTaper Ultimate, which is the first major endodontic platform innovation introduced in its endo business in more than five years. As part of a new platform, this will include new files of biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device.
Apart from this, the company will also introduce multiple new motor systems in the upcoming months. It will launch CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan, as it further enhances speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace.
During the third quarter, DENTSPLY witnessed double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe, and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment.
Apart from these proven products, the company has an excellent new product pipeline that will aid its performance in 2023 and beyond. DENTSPLY initiated a comprehensive review of the entire business to improve execution, build a winning portfolio and return to growth, during 2022. Moreover, the completion of internal investigation removes a major overhang for the company.
What's Weighing on It?
DENTSPLY recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 billion net of tax during the third quarter. The charge reflected the impact of macroeconomic factors as a result of weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain and service costs.
Macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness continued for DENTSPLY in China and the United States. Management was not satisfied with the third quarter result.
Estimates Trend
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.8% from 2022’s preliminary number.
For 2023, the consensus mark for adjusted earnings per share stands at $1.87, suggesting a decline of 4.6% from 2022.

Does Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,27-Jan-23,We note that Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) does have debt on its balance  sheet. But ... Yahoo Finance. Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power  gaming and AI...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-ford-motor-nyse-f-110013761.html,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What Is Ford Motor's Debt?
You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Ford Motor had US$128.3b of debt in September 2022, down from US$144.6b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$32.0b, its net debt is less, at about US$96.4b.
debt-equity-history-analysis
How Strong Is Ford Motor's Balance Sheet?
The latest balance sheet data shows that Ford Motor had liabilities of US$90.2b due within a year, and liabilities of US$114.7b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$32.0b as well as receivables valued at US$14.8b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$158.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.
This deficit casts a shadow over the US$51.9b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. After all, Ford Motor would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.
Strangely Ford Motor has a sky high EBITDA ratio of 5.8, implying high debt, but a strong interest coverage of 10.6. So either it has access to very cheap long term debt or that interest expense is going to grow! Notably, Ford Motor's EBIT launched higher than Elon Musk, gaining a whopping 179% on last year. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Ford Motor can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last two years, Ford Motor generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 92% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.
Our View
We feel some trepidation about Ford Motor's difficulty level of total liabilities, but we've got positives to focus on, too. For example, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow and EBIT growth rate give us some confidence in its ability to manage its debt. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Ford Motor is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Ford Motor you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.
If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.

Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and  AI...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutions-own-49-ford-motor-110015163.html,"Every investor in Ford Motor Company ( NYSE:F ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 50% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 49% of the company's stockholders. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ford Motor.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Ford Motor does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ford Motor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Ford Motor. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.4% and 3.7% of the stock. We would also like to add that the Ford family owns a significant portion of the company's Class B stock (40% voting rights as per the latest annual report).
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Ford Motor Company. Insiders own US$658m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 50% stake in Ford Motor. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
But ultimately it is the future , not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .

30 Largest Trading Partners of the U.S.,27-Jan-23,Not only are legacy carmakers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and  General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) a central part of the American economy  but the...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-largest-trading-partners-u-152349908.html,"In this piece, we will take a look at the thirty largest trading partners of the U.S. For the top 10 trading partners, take a look at 10 Largest Trading Partners of the U.S.
Despite a large decline in industrial production over the past few decades, the U.S. is still one of the world's largest economies and the second largest exporter. According to data from the United Nations, America's exports stood at $1.75 trillion in 2021, for a billion dollar lead over Germany, the world's third largest exporter, and a large lag behind China, the largest exporter on the globe.
A little known fact about the U.S. is that its largest exports are processed petroleum products and crude oil. This is unsurprising though, as a well-developed fracking industry and the largest oil companies in the world are both found in America. For instance, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has a market capitalization of $349 billion and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is even larger as it is valued at $468 billion on the open market. They are two of the three largest oil companies, and the only larger entity is Saudi Aramco - a firm owned by the Saudi government.
However, America isn't known only for its oil and gas exports. Courtesy of chipmakers such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), integrated circuits are the U.S.' fifth largest export - with a total value of $52 billion was only $2 billion shy of the fourth largest item - cars. Once again, when it comes to automobiles, America once again has the leading players in the world apart from Germany and Japan. Not only are legacy carmakers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) a central part of the American economy, but the world's first electric vehicle mass production firm Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also American.
Yet, even though the world's largest smartphone company Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also American, U.S. smartphone exports stood at $31 billion in 2021. This surprising fact touches upon a controversial point for America's economy, known as the trade deficit. While America had cumulatively sold $1.75 trillion of products in 2021, it had also bought $2.9 trillion of goods and services - leading to more goods moving out of the U.S. than had moved in. Where does Apple fit in? Well, despite being an American company, Apple's iPhones are actually imported into the U.S. as they are manufactured by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:HNHPF), or Foxconn, in China. This then ends up distorting the data, as products sold with American branding actually end up being imported into the U.S. instead.

Passenger Electric Vehicle to Account for 60% of All New Cars Sold by 2030:
The adoption of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to increase significantly over the next decade, with projections indicating that they will account for 50% of all new cars sold by 2028. There are several factors driving this trend, including advancements in technology, increased environmental concerns, and changing consumer preferences. In 2021, more than 16.5 million electric cars were running on roads around the globe; it is expected that this number will reach 310 million units by 2028.
One of the primary drivers for the growth in EV adoption is the growing concern about the environmental impact of transportation. EVs produce zero emissions at the tailpipe and have lower emissions over their entire life cycle compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). As governments and consumers become more aware of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, there is an increasing demand for low-emission transportation options.
Apart from this, consumer preferences are also shifting towards EVs. As awareness increases, more consumers are considering them as a viable alternative to ICEVs. Additionally, the growing availability of charging infrastructure, including both public charging stations and home charging options, makes it more convenient for consumers to own and operate an EV. Furthermore, some governments are offering incentives such as tax breaks and credits to encourage consumers to purchase EVs, making them even more attractive.

The S&P 500's most heavily-weighted components — Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Facebook parent company Meta (FB) — are among important players scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results through Friday.
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fed officials will meet Jan. 31-Feb 1 and are expected to raise interest rates by 0.25% in Wednesday's policy decision. A press conference held by Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will offer investors crucial signs regarding the central bank's path forward on rate increases.
Finally, rounding out the week on Friday morning will be the government's January jobs report, set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 185,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, consensus estimates from Bloomberg show.

The 2023 rally will face its biggest test yet this week as mega-cap technology companies report earnings at at a critical juncture for their businesses.
These results come as technology layoffs ramp up after hiring swelled during the post-pandemic boom. Last week, Alphabet announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs, while layoffs at Amazon and Meta Platforms also stand in the tens of thousands as growth comes back down to earth after surging in 2021.
On Wednesday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are poised to lift rates by 25 basis points, marking another slowdown from the 0.50% rate increase the Fed announced in December, which itself was a step down from the 0.75% pace of rate hikes seen during the prior four meetings.
The FOMC will announce its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a press conference beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET. The CME FedWatch Tool, which serves as a barometer for what investors believe the central bank's next move will be, shows markets are pricing in a 99.8% chance of a 25 basis point hike on Wednesday.
""As the FOMC gathers for the first time in 2023, it will face a difficult challenge: how to communicate a desire to maintain a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance while avoiding the risk of overtightening,"" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a note. ""And, with its dance partner – i.e. markets – desiring a much slower dance tempo, carefully crafted communication will be essential to avoid a tumble.""

Elsewhere on the economic data front, the January jobs report comes out on Friday. The employment picture has moderated in recent months, but demand for workers remains high, with the labor market breezing through the Fed's monetary tightening campaign.
December's data showed the labor market added a robust 223,000 jobs during the month, and a monthly average of 375,00 during all of last year — even as 425 basis points worth of rate hikes permeated through the economy.
Strategists who have doubted market expectations for the Fed to pause rate hikes point to continued labor market tightness, as wage pressures still pose a risk to inflation, even as consumer price increases continue to slow from multi-decade highs reached in the summer of 2022.
""We need activity weakness to translate to job losses to address Powell’s preferred services ex-shelter inflation metric, where wages are the primary driver,"" Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, head of Multi-Asset Retail Investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a recent note to clients. ""We continue to think that we should not fight the Fed because they will demonstrate a slow reaction function on inflationary risk management.""
Overall, fourth quarter earnings season continues to be a modest disappointment, though the market's performance this year shows investors are largely not surprised.
Of the 29% of S&P 500 companies that have reported results to date, just 69% have seen earnings per share come in above estimates, below the 5-year average of 77% and 10-year average of 73%, per data from FactSet.
For Amazon, key headwinds investors will be looking for color on include softening consumer discretionary spending and decelerating growth for its cloud business, AWS, according to Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.
""Matters on cost cutting and belt-tightening initiatives will be front and center, as CEO Andy Jassy recently confirmed plans to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, which we forecast could result in more than $3 billion in savings,"" Sundaram said in a note.
For Apple, momentum on iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by investors, while markets will be looking for any clues Alphabet offers on the state of the advertising business, given its exposure to this market through its Search and YouTube segments.
Other big names set to report include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Caterpillar (CAT), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Ford (F).
Though with a roster of companies reporting results this deep, big splashes and surprising releases are no doubt going to be a part of the coming week's market narrative.
Outside of Friday's jobs report, the typical mix of month-end economic data will also feature, with manufacturing readouts from the Institute for Supply Management and S&P Global set for Wednesday, as well as Tuesday's reading on consumer confidence from The Conference Board, all set to be closely watched.
On the labor side, Wednesday's private payrolls data from ADP and Thursday's weekly report on initial jobless claims will set the table for Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.

Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-renault-nissan-aim-announce-110958101.html,"By Norihiko Shirouzu, Gilles Guillaume and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) -French car maker Renault and its Japanese partner Nissan Motor aim to formally unveil a deal to reshape their alliance in London on Feb. 6, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Leaders of the two companies met via video link for an alliance board meeting on Thursday following months of intense negotiations over how to reset their long-running partnership. They opted for that format - rather than having Renault CEO Luca de Meo and Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard travel to Japan - because the talks have been progressing well, sources had previously told Reuters.
A third source close to the matter said Thursday's meeting had gone off ""without a hitch"" but there were details that still needed to be worked out.
""As of today, we cannot say that we have reached an agreement,"" the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential, said.
The source added there was no major gap between the two companies and that the negotiations were unlikely to break down. But he also said that the Feb. 6 date for an announcement was not written in stone yet.
The boards of the two companies would still need to individually approve a potential deal after Thursday's meeting.
Renault is looking for the Japanese automaker to invest in its new electric-vehicle business while Nissan wants Renault, its top shareholder, to sell down its roughly 43% stake and put the 23-year alliance on a more equal footing.
Renault has consistently declined to comment publicly about the talks with its Japanese partner, while a spokesperson for Nissan declined to comment on Thursday.
The two companies are expected to announce five joint projects to relaunch the alliance, covering manufacturing, technology and further geographical development, including in India, one of the sources told Reuters.
It was not immediately clear if already announced deals to produce the successor to the Nissan Micra in a Renault plant in France and junior alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp's new ASX and Colt in Renault plants in Spain and Turkey would be considered part of those five projects.
Renault boss de Meo has said the company had proposed working together on 10-15 projects.
The future shape of the Franco-Japanese alliance has implications for both companies as well as Mitsubishi Motors. It also highlights how the immense technological upheaval in the auto industry is forcing companies to both partner and compete with a dizzying number of newcomers and tech firms.
Renault, for instance, has said it will partner with companies from China's Geely Automobile Holdings to semiconductor giant Qualcomm Inc.
Renault is separately working to finalise a deal with Geely and to bring in Saudi Arabian state oil producer Aramco as an investor and partner to develop gasoline engines and hybrid technologies, Reuters has reported.
Nissan has been concerned that the technology it has developed while partnered with Renault could leak to the French automaker's partners as it restructures, Reuters has reported.
One of the sources who spoke to Reuters on Thursday however said those concerns had now been addressed.

Ford sinks after Q4 profits miss expectations CEO says $2 ...,02-Feb-23,... company earnings news click here · Read the latest financial and  business news from Yahoo Finance. Download the Yahoo Finance app for Apple  or Android. Follow...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-fourth-quarter-earnings-february-2-2023-145214798.html,"Ford (F) shares sunk late Thursday after the automaker reported fourth quarter profits that missed expectations and CEO Jim Farley said the company ""should have done much better last year.""
Ford reported quarter adjusted EBIT — or earnings before interest and taxes — of $2.6 billion, missing Wall Street expectations for $3.45 billion. On a per-share basis, adjusted profits also missed expectations, coming in at $0.51 against analyst forecasts for $0.62. Ford shares were down as much as 8% in after hours trade on Thursday.
For the quarter, Ford reported;
Revenue: $44.0 billion vs. $39.9 billion expected
Adjusted EPS: $0.51 vs. $0.62 expected
Adj. EBIT: $2.6 billion vs. $3.45 billion expected
The revenue figure represents a 17% jump compared to a year ago, where Ford was still struggling with component and chip shortages.
On the profitability front, Ford reported full year adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $10.4 billion, below prior guidance of $11.5 billion.
""We should have done much better last year,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. ""We left about $2 billion in profits on the table that were within our control, and we’re going to correct that with improved execution and performance.""
Ford announced a 2023 full-year EBIT forecast of $9 billion to $11 billion; the consensus estimate was for around $10 billion. Ford also declared a first-quarter regular dividend of 15 cents per share and a supplemental dividend of 65 cents per share, which reflects the company monetizing its stake in Rivian.
Last quarter, Ford CFO John Lawler noted some of customers were hesitating at higher sticker prices, and using longer-term loan financing to ease monthly payments. Lawler also said Ford was seeing customers passing on higher trim levels in order to purchase more affordable vehicles.
The street expected Ford to have a strong quarter following GM’s monster Q4 performance, where the automaker reported a huge profit beat and record revenue. GM also hit the top end of its full-year 2022 EBIT forecast, and also guided its full-year 2023 higher than analysts were expecting, seeing $11.5 billion in EBIT this year.
Investors will be watching for any more color on demand issues creeping up for Ford due to slower macro conditions and higher interest rates. Ford said in its earnings release that potential headwinds it sees include ""a mild recession in the U.S. and moderate recession in Europe; higher industrywide customer incentives, as vehicle supply-and-demand rebalances; a lower profit from Ford Credit.""
On the flipside, Ford said it sees potential tailwinds like ""supply chain improvements and higher industry volumes; launch of the all-new Super Duty truck; and lower costs of goods sold, including for materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of the industrial platform.""

""We believe a key focus of investors will be on Ford’s ability to improve its structural margins while also profitably transitioning towards secularly growing EV and ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems] related products,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a new client note.
The Street made its concerns heard in Friday's trading session.
The legendary automaker's stock fell 6% in the wake of a disappointing quarter for profits. Ford's ticker page was the most viewed on the Yahoo Finance platform through midday.
Execs at the company pinned the blame on still-high costs of production for gas-powered autos and expenses associated with the shift to EV development, among other factors.
Here is how Ford performed in the fourth quarter versus Wall Street estimates:
Ford Earnings Overview
Revenue: $44.0 billion vs. $39.9 billion expected
Adjusted EPS: $0.51 vs. $0.62 expected
Adj. EBIT: $2.6 billion vs. $3.45 billion expected
Wins: 1) Sense of urgency by management on the need to cut costs; 2) Strong balance sheet.
Misses: 1) Ugly earnings miss, suggesting still overly optimistic Street estimates; 2) No. 1 in U.S. recalls over the past two years.
One positive from the quarter — if anything — was that Ford CEO Jim Farley was fired up on the earnings call.

Farley is credited with reviving the company's image among Wall Streeters and the public, mostly through the debut of hot-selling EVs such as the Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. But the CEO acknowledged on the call that the 2022 profit performance was unacceptable and he and his team are ""on it,"" so to speak.
""Our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance last year fell short of our potential,"" Farley told analysts. ""And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts. And to say I'm frustrated is an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford.""
Farley's tone on costs was in stark contrast to that of rival GM (GM) earlier in the week. GM was generally seen as managing expenses well in the fourth quarter, with CFO Paul Jacobson telling Yahoo Finance Live (video above) the company is targeting $2 billion in cost cuts this year.

""The surprise Q4 miss [for Ford] will likely overshadow the guidance since the near-term story now becomes about proving execution,"" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. ""We expect the shares to trade down and potentially stay range-bound until the May 22nd Investor Day. We continue to prefer GM and do not see much of an incremental read-across from Ford's results.""

The electric vehicle (EV) industry was heavily impacted by the economic downturn in 2022. As interest rates increased and financial markets fluctuated, the stock prices of many EV firms declined. This was a disappointing year for investors who had invested in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and other companies with high exposure to the EV industry. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), which had a market value higher than Ford Motor Co. shortly after going public in 2021, lost over 70% of its value in the past year.
The situation for EV start-ups was even direr. Arrival, an electric van manufacturer, warned that it could run out of cash in less than a year. Lucid Group Inc. (LCID.O), supported by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, encountered difficulties in constructing its luxurious Air EVs. Xpeng Inc., a Chinese competitor to Tesla, saw its shares decrease in value by over 80%. 
However, despite these challenges, the outlook for the EV industry in 2023 is optimistic. According to Reuters, despite low sales, electric vehicle production is set to surge in 2023. In 2022, well-established automobile manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ford, and General Motors introduced numerous new electric vehicles to compete with Tesla and other start-ups. The ramp-up of mass production for these vehicles will commence in 2023. Tesla Inc. rises to become the top-valued automobile company globally with a market share of 65%. The total EV industry is worth around $800 billion as of right now.
According to S&P Global, the market share for electric vehicles in new vehicle sales is predicted to reach 40% by 2030. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, has stated that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be the most valuable company in the world. During the most recent earnings call, Elon Musk reported that the company saw its strongest orders to date in January. The last quarter also marked Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s highest-ever quarterly revenue, operating income, and net income in its history. Additionally, Tesla cut global EV prices by up to 20%, intensifying competition through aggressive discounts.
Governments around the world are also supporting the growth of the EV industry through incentives and regulations. The push towards sustainable transportation is increasing, which is expected to further drive the growth of the EV industry in the coming years. The market for charging infrastructure is also expected to grow, creating new opportunities for companies in this sector.
The increasing demand for EVs is also expected to drive growth in the lithium-ion battery market. A report by Technavio predicts that the global lithium-ion battery market will grow by 17% in 2023, driven by the increasing demand for EVs and energy storage systems. The industry is also expected to see growth in the recycling and reuse of batteries, as companies look for ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.

Over the past several years, GM has taken the steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into a position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world.

The Normal, Illinois-based company ended the quarter with 2,000 vehicles in transit, representing less than 5% of its FY23 projections. 
On January 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating on Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RINV) stock and lowered the price target to $28 from $55, noting that electric vehicles, or EVs, are transitioning from a severe lack of inventory to a potential surplus, and Tesla's recent price reductions are just the latest indication the EV market may be entering the ‘shake-out' phase.

In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) manufactures electric vehicles (EVs) for the consumer and commercial markets. We initially invested in the company when it was privately owned. Among the many things that differentiate this startup is its substantial cash balance and relationship with Amazon, which is both an investor in the company and the first customer for Rivian’s commercial van. Several positive developments contributed to share strength in the quarter, including the company’s announcement that production of its R1 pickup trucks and EV delivery vans increased nearly 70% over the previous quarter. Management also reaffirmed its production target of 25,000 vehicles for 2022. Despite raising the price of its R1 truck earlier this year, Rivian continued to see strong demand for its vehicles, demonstrated by 98,000 pre-orders for its R1 truck and SUV. Although we are pleased with the company’s progress, we liquidated our position as Rivian approached the high end of our market cap threshold and its relative valuation became less attractive.”

US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.
A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.
Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals. That’s why in this article we will list some stocks with low PE ratios.

However, as the industry contains several renowned companies, the entry of new firms is very challenging, which, in turn, may hinder the automotive finance market growth in the near future.

Drivers who are convicted of serious traffic violations in Virginia may be required to hold an SR-22 certificate in order to reinstate their suspended license. While commonly referred to as SR-22 insurance, this certificate is actually not insurance at all, but acts as proof that the driver holds the minimum auto insurance required by their state. In Virginia, however, some circumstances may necessitate an FR-44, which involves much more severe consequences than the standard SR-22 forms used across other states.
What is “SR-22 insurance?”
Contrary to popular belief, SR-22 forms are not insurance at all. Rather, an SR-22 form is a special certificate that is filed with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles which signifies that you hold the minimum auto insurance required by your state. Virginia generally uses the form FR-44 for more severe situations, which may be issued to drivers who:
Have unsatisfied judgements
Fail to provide proof of insurance
Operate a motor vehicle without insurance
Falsify auto insurance certifications
Are convicted of vehicular manslaughter
Commit perjury regarding vehicle registration or a valid driver’s license
Commit a felony that involves a motor vehicle
Are involved in a hit-and-run
Are convicted of maiming under the influence, driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs, driving with a suspended license, or found guilty in any juvenile case
To receive an SR-22 certificate in Virginia, drivers will first need to provide proof of financial responsibility. This is typically done by obtaining a high-risk insurance policy. Once you have a qualifying insurance policy in place, notify your carrier of the SR-22 requirement. After they have completed the form, they should submit it to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, where it remains on-file for at least three consecutive years.
SR-22 Virginia alternatives
If the violation you committed is particularly severe, Virginia may issue what’s known as an FR-44. These certificates are for violations involving maiming under the influence, driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, or being convicted in any juvenile case. Depending on the state in which you live, you may be required to file an SR-44 or alternative in accordance with your state’s guidelines. The following outlines the different forms similar to SR-22s that may be required:
Form
States issued
Required insurance minimums
SR-22
All states except Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania
Insurance minimums by state
FR-19
Delaware and Maryland
Delaware: $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident/$10,000 per property damage
Maryland: $30,000 per person/$60,000 per accident/$15,000 per property damage
SR-21
Hawaii
$20,000 per person/$40,000 per accident/$10,000 per property damage
SR-22A
Georgia
$25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident/$25,000 per property damage
FR-44
Florida and Virginia
Florida: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident/$50,000 per property damage
Virginia: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident/$40,000 per property damage
SR-50
Indiana
$25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident/$10,000 per property damage
FR-19: These forms are issued in Delaware and Maryland, and serve to verify that the driver currently holds the minimum insurance required by their state. Unlike SR-22s, which are required for drivers who have been convicted of more serious driving violations, FR-19 forms simply act as verification of coverage.
SR-21: Unique to Hawaii, SR-21 forms certify that drivers have the minimum liability insurance required by the state. Drivers who have committed a DUI or multiple moving violations may be required to file an SR-21 form.
SR-22A: In Georgia, drivers seeking to reinstate their suspended license may need to file the Georgia Safety Responsibility Insurance Certificate known as an SR-22A. These certificates are required to remain in effect for at least three consecutive years from the date of your conviction.
FR-44: Virginia drivers may be penalized more severely with an FR-44 depending on the type of violation they commit. Only used in Virginia and Florida, these forms increase the minimum coverage requirements for high-risk drivers dramatically. In Virginia, those required to hold an FR-44 are obligated to hold at least double the minimum auto insurance required in the state.
SR-50: An SR-50 form is issued only in Indiana if the state notifies you that you are required to hold such a certificate. Usually, drivers receive notification if they are found to be driving without the minimum required insurance or if they have had their license suspended.
Non-owner SR-22
If you have received an SR-22 requirement, but no longer — or do not currently — own your own vehicle and still wish to reinstate your license, you’ll likely need to obtain a non-owners auto insurance policy. A non-owners auto insurance policy is issued to drivers who do not own the vehicle they operate. This form certifies that you have the minimum state-required auto insurance under a non-owners insurance policy, enabling you to fulfill the requirements of an SR-22.
FR-44 in Virginia
If a driver commits a particularly serious offense in Virginia, they may be required to hold an FR-44. An FR-44 is different from an SR-22 in that it requires drivers to hold twice the minimum required auto insurance in the state. FR-44s are required for the following convictions:
Maiming while under the influence
Driving while under the influence of drugs/alcohol
Driving while the driver’s license has been forfeited for a conviction, or a guilty conviction in a juvenile case
Violation of the provisions of any federal law or law of any other state or any valid local ordinance similar to the aforementioned violations
When a driver is required to hold an FR-44 in Virginia, they must have the following insurance coverage limits in place:
$50,000 per person
$100,000 per accident
$40,000 per property damage
SR-22 Virginia insurance costs
Drivers considered to be high-risk typically pay higher premiums for their car insurance than drivers who have a clear driving record. Additionally, there are other expenses associated with being a high-risk driver such as fines and court costs. For example, Virginia drivers who must file a SR-22 or FR-44 are charged between $15 and $35 for a filing fee. However, the impacts to insurance premiums are directly related to the violation that prompted the SR-22 requirement rather than the SR-22 itself.
If your requirement is due to having a DUI in Virginia, your insurance premium could increase significantly. In some cases, a DUI may disqualify you for standard coverage from your insurance company. In this event, you may need to purchase coverage from a provider specializing in high-risk car insurance. Because an FR-44 requires drivers to hold double the minimum coverage amount, another impact to your insurance may be the cost associated with increasing your policy limits. As a high-risk driver, the best way to secure the most affordable rate is to maintain good driving habits and get quotes from several different companies before making a decision.
Frequently asked questions
How long do I need an SR-22 in Virginia?

In most cases, SR-22 certificates are required to be active for three consecutive years following the date of the driver’s conviction or qualifying incident.
[sc code=""alpine_collapse""]
How do I get SR-22 insurance in Virginia?

The first step to filing for an SR-22 certificate in Virginia is to find a high-risk auto insurance policy. After you’ve obtained a policy, inform your carrier of the SR-22 or FR-44 requirement and have them file the certificate with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. The forms should remain on-file for at least three consecutive years from the date of your conviction.
[sc code=""alpine_collapse""]
How much does SR-22 insurance cost in Virginia?

“SR-22 insurance” is a misnomer. SR-22s act solely as proof that the driver possesses the minimum auto insurance required by Virginia state law. In Virginia, the cost to file an SR-22 certificate ranges between $15 and $35 depending on a few factors. Because drivers holding an SR-22 are more likely to be considered high-risk, insurance carriers may charge more in premiums.
[sc code=""alpine_collapse""]
What is the minimum auto insurance coverage requirement in Virginia?

The minimum amount of auto insurance required in Virginia is $25,000 liability coverage per person, $50,000 per accident and $20,0000 in property damage. Typically written as 25/50/20, this amount is the lowest coverage available in order to satisfy state requirements and proof of insurance for an SR-22. If you are required to file an FR-44, your policy limit requirements are doubled.

Chip Ganassi receives Championship Team Owner's Trophy™ for sixth time
AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Feb. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BorgWarner presented Marcus Ericsson with his first BorgWarner Championship Driver's Trophy™, fondly known as the Baby Borg, in commemoration of his victory at the 106th Indianapolis 500. The trophy presentation took place on February 2nd at a special ceremony at The Thermal Club in Palm Springs, California.
Marcus Ericsson, Michelle Collins and Chip Ganassi with the Borg-Warner Trophy at the Baby Borg ceremony in Palm Springs, California February 2, 2023
Ericsson driving the No. 8 Huski Chocolate, Chip Ganassi Racing Honda, became just the second driver from Sweden to win ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" – Kenny Brack in 1999 was the first.
""We were excited to present Marcus with his first Baby Borg and congratulate him, once again, on his tremendous victory at the Indy 500,"" said Michelle Collins, Global Director Marketing and Public Relations, BorgWarner. ""Our team had the opportunity to travel to Sweden with Marcus and the Borg-Warner Trophy® late last year to help celebrate his accomplishment. The energy and excitement around his win in his hometown was palpable and we hope this miniature replica of the Borg-Warner Trophy can continue to bring him back to that moment and his experience in Victory Circle for years to come.""
Following his Indy 500 victory, a specially crafted replica of Ericsson's face was sculpted by William Behrends and permanently affixed to the Borg-Warner Trophy in October amongst those of previous victors dating back to 1911. At the Baby Borg ceremony, Ericsson was presented with a one-of-a-kind replica of the iconic Trophy, featuring a duplicate of the hand-crafted, three-dimensional sterling silver image affixed to the full-sized Trophy. Along with Ericsson's likeness, the base of the Baby Borg is also inscribed with the winner's name, team name, average race speed and year of win. Weighing five pounds and standing 20 inches tall, the Baby Borg is made of sterling silver and serves as a keepsake and has been given to Indy 500 winners to recognize their accomplishments since 1988.
The 5' 4 ¾"", 110-pound, sterling silver Borg-Warner Trophy, after traveling to Ericsson's home country of Sweden in November 2022 to celebrate his achievement, returned to its home at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum where it is kept on permanent display.
""I always dreamed of winning the Indianapolis 500 and having something as unique as the Baby Borg to celebrate that dream coming true is a wonderful gift,"" said Ericsson. ""Thank you to BorgWarner for this trophy, it is something I will always treasure, and I hope to add more to my trophy case in the future.""
Chip Ganassi, owner of Chip Ganassi Racing, was presented with the Championship Team Owner's Trophy. This was the 6th time Ganassi received a Championship Team Owner's Baby Borg. In 1989, Ganassi was team co-owner with U.E. ""Pat"" Patrick when Emerson Fittipaldi won the 500 and sole team owner for his next five wins at Indianapolis Motor Speedway – Juan Pablo Montoya (2000), Scott Dixon (2008), Dario Franchitti (2010 and 2012) and Ericsson all winning under Chip Ganassi Racing teams. This trophy was first established in 1998.
""It's always a privilege to be awarded a Baby Borg after winning the Indianapolis 500,"" said Ganassi. ""I couldn't be prouder of Marcus and the entire team. What a great way to commemorate this special achievement.""

Why Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Could Be Worth Watching,08-Feb-23,However there are also other important factors which we haven't considered  today such as the financial strength of the company. ... Yahoo Finance.  Nvidia debuts...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ford-motor-company-nyse-110110720.html,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Ford Motor’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What's The Opportunity In Ford Motor?
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.24% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ford Motor today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $12.31, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
What does the future of Ford Motor look like?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Ford Motor, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 0.8% in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in F’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on F, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Ford Motor and you'll want to know about these.

Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-farley-cfo-lawler-190000280.html,"DEARBORN, Mich., February 06, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley and Chief Financial Officer John Lawler will discuss the company’s ambitious, customer-focused plan to grow and create value – and the double transformation bringing it to life – at an upcoming fireside chat with auto analyst Rod Lache.
The session at the Wolfe Research Global Auto, Auto Tech, and Auto Consumer Conference 2023 in New York City will take place Wednesday, Feb. 15, at 8:55 a.m. EST.
Farley and Lawler will answer questions about the Ford+ growth plan; how the company is overhauling its operations to improve quality and reduce costs; and its significant opportunities to expand capabilities and generate returns from software-enabled gas-powered and electric vehicles, along with value-added services.
To accelerate this transformation, Ford has created three distinct, customer-focused business segments: Ford Blue for iconic internal-combustion and hybrid vehicles, Ford Model e for breakthrough software and EVs, and Ford Pro for products and services that help commercial customers make over and grow their businesses.

Ford, which wrote down the value of its Rivian investment by $7.4 billion in 2022, had said last week that the monetization of its stake in Rivian was ""nearly complete"". Ford held an 11.4% stake in Rivian at the end of 2021.
Shares of Rivian fell 3.4% in afternoon trade. The stock had a poor run in 2022, losing about 82% of its value as the company reeled from supply chain disruptions and missed its full-year production target of 25,000 units.
Reuters reported last week that Rivian was planning to lay off 6% of its staff amid falling cash reserves.
Ford's updated stake in the company was disclosed in a Wednesday filing.
Rivian declined to comment on Ford's stake sale.

Lithium Battery Production By Country: Top 12 Countries,10-Feb-23,(NASDAQ:TSLA) Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV). We  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-battery-production-country-top-183050554.html,"In this article, we discuss lithium battery production by country. If you want to read about some top countries in terms of lithium battery production, go directly to Lithium Battery Production by Country: Top 5 Countries.
Several countries are key players in the battery tech manufacturing industry and claim a major share of the global market. These countries are home to large battery manufacturers, and often have well-developed supply chains and infrastructure to support the production of batteries on a large scale. Some of the key battery tech manufacturing countries include China, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Germany, and India. These countries have big EV firms like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV). 
We talked about the 10 most advanced battery technologies in a separate article in detail. Battery tech manufacturers are situated around the world, and they produce a wide range of battery types, including lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, and nickel-metal hydride batteries, among others. Many small countries are also involved in the production and development of batteries. As technology is emerging, many countries across the globe are beginning to enter the battery manufacturing industry. 
Chinese firms dominate the electric vehicle (EV) battery market, accounting for 56% of the market share. Four of the ten largest battery manufacturers are based in China. South Korean companies and Japanese firms also have a significant presence in the market. Several major battery companies are based in the United States, including QuantumScape, A123 Systems, Enovix, SES AI, and Amprius Tech. 
Considering lithium reserves, Chile has the largest known reserves of lithium in the world, with a total of 8 million tons. This puts it ahead of other countries with significant reserves, such as Australia (2.7 million tons), Argentina (2 million tons), and China (1 million tons). In Europe, Portugal also has smaller deposits of lithium. 
The global battery technology market size is expected to grow from $95.7 billion in 2022 to $136.6 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. The adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles and the increasing usage of wearable devices are responsible for the growth of the battery technology market size. Some other sectors, such as solar and wind energy systems, are also emerging and the world is making its way towards environment-friendly energy.
The global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), falling battery prices and increased investment by top automobile OEMs are what are fueling the growth of the total EV battery industry. Additional factors include increased investments in expanding lithium-ion battery capacity, the expansion of battery-as-a-service systems, and rising acceptance of electric mobility in emerging nations, all of which present major market prospects.
The factors that limit the global EV market include the less energy-dense batteries and probable shortage of lithium mining capacity, and possible safety concerns with EV batteries are posing a threat to the market's expansion for EV batteries. Considering the EV battery production by country, with a 56% market share, Chinese companies lead the industry. China is home to many in the top 10 battery producers list. Japanese and South Korean businesses are likewise well-represented in the sector. Furthermore, Chinese battery is also leading in the battery supply chain, mining metals and refining battery components, etc.
Korean companies contributed a 26% share in global EV battery production last year. Samsung SDI, SK On and LG Energy Solutions are a few notable contributors to the market. The aforementioned companies provide EV batteries to automotive giants such as Tesla, Ford Motors and General Motors. Japanese companies are another key player in EV battery production with 10% of the total EV production worldwide. Companies such as Panasonic ranks 4th among the world’s largest battery-producing companies.
Around 948 GWh of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery capacity is currently deployed globally. Out of this, the global EV battery production capacity is almost 274 GWh. If the recent trends in the adoption of EVs and E-mobility are considered, several thousand GWh of batteries will also be needed to accommodate the tens of millions of EVs that will be added each year.
Between 2021 and 2027, the demand for Li-ion batteries from light vehicles will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 40%, reaching roughly 2,050 GWh as predicted by S&P Global Mobility. In the same time frame, installed battery capacity will increase by 23.5% CAGR to 3,371 GWh in 2027.
The Asia-Pacific region again takes the lead when the largest lithium battery producers are concerned. Several major companies in the list of largest lithium battery producers are from China. Notable names include CATL and BYD with a total production capacity of 137.7 GWh and 51.5 GWh respectively in the year 2022. The US was able to produce 44 GWh of lithium-ion batteries in 2021, and by 2025, that capacity is expected to increase to 91 GWh. The development of technology in the US has had a significant impact on battery production as well. The US provided the majority of cutting-edge battery technology.

Investors are still trying to make sense of the latest market rally that began with a lot of optimism as we entered 2023. Major technology stocks as well as crypto currencies have gained significant value since the start of the year. However, the latest jobs report which showed the persistent strength of the labor market is causing many analysts to believe the Federal Reserve could continue its rate hikes, potentially crushing hopes for a soft landing.
""History is Not On Our Side""
According to a 2023 market outlook report by T. Rowe Price, the “history” is not on our side when we try to predict what would happen in 2023 when it comes to recession. The report said that 10 of the last 13 hiking cycles ended in recession in the US, and that the Fed has never lowered inflation by 4% or more without triggering a recession. The report also said that there has never been a spike in inflation above 5% that didn’t result in a recession.
Stock Market Outlook and Expectations for 2023
Overall, T. Rowe Price said that value stocks is a safer bet for 2023 as the firm said value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks in high‑inflation periods.
“Value also appears historically inexpensive relative to growth, even though U.S. value benchmarks significantly outperformed their growth counterparts in 2022,” T. Rowe’s report said.
Interestingly, T. Rowe thinks small-cap stocks provide an opportunity for investors, especially if the US economy does not fall into a recession. The report said that historically, small-cap stocks recover more quickly than large-cap stocks during economic recoveries. T. Rowe also thinks the valuations of small-cap companies in the US appear more attractive than large-cap stocks.
The T. Rowe report also said that the pessimism around the economic future of China is “overblown”. It was referring to the massive battering of Chinese stocks in 2022 as the country suffered slowing growth and COVID-19-related problems. T. Rowe said China has take “demonstrable steps” to solve the COVID-19 problem and accelerate economic and earnings growth. The report said China’s leadership remains “pro-growth.” It noted that most of the growth in China came from the property sector, but that era is “coming to an end.”

10. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42
Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) shares are on investors’ radar after the company posted quarterly results and gave a weak guidance. Investment firm UBS downgraded Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) to Neutral from Buy, with a $10 price target. The analyst said that while Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) has potential to grow its revenues, it’s operating in a highly competitive space.
Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:
“SNAP shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth, while announcing a broadbased cost restructuring.
Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”
9. Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43
Used car company Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) ranks 9th in our list of the best high-volume stocks to buy right now. Last month, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) said it will continue to buy and sell cars in Illinois following a settlement with the Illinois Secretary of State. Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA)’s license was suspended last year amid violations of Illinois’ vehicle code. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) has cut several jobs and also reduced working hours for its staff to cut costs and lighten its debt.
As of the end of the third quarter of 2022, 43 hedge funds had stakes in Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), compared to 47 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these shares was over $656 million.
Steel City Capital made the following comment about Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:
“As I write, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), a long-time short, is circling the drain. After reporting earnings, shares have been roughly cut in half while the company’s bonds are now priced anywhere from 35- to 45-cents on the dollar, with yields ranging from 25% to 40%. While the shares already experienced a steep decline during the past year, the postearnings sell-off appears to reflect investors finally acknowledging the company’s near-term liquidity issues. Raising capital – debt or equity – seems unlikely, if not impossible. Bulls had been holding on to the hope CVNA would meet its stated “goal” of generating “significantly positive EBITDA in FY 2023,” but management walked back that aspiration last week. I always thought the word “goal” reflected squishy language that never carried the same weight as “guidance” and drew conclusions accordingly. The difference is much the same as me telling my wife I have a “goal” of having washboard abs vs. “guidance” that I will have them by swimsuit season. The language was deliberate (and probably highly lawyered), and in my estimation, reflected an effort to give bulls something to cling on to without the company exposing itself to a lawsuit when they (inevitably) missed.”
8. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) ranks 8th in our list of the best high-volume stocks to buy today.

7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69

ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:
“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”
6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Alger Capital made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Shares underperformed during the quarter as it confronted transportation capacity issues that caused deliveries to fall short of estimates, as well as developing demand softness. Moreover, the demand softness became evident in increased Model 3 and Y discounts, the introduction of supercharging credits, some consumers deferring purchases until the Inflation Reduction Act EV purchase incentives become effective in January 2023, and other consumers who may be influenced by higher financing rates or deterred from initiating a high-ticket purchase. Despite these near-term difficulties, we remain constructive on EV innovation, adoption, and Tesla’s growth prospects over the long-term.”

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-advanced-countries-battery-153754101.html,"In this article, we discuss the 10 most advanced countries in battery technology. If you want to read about some more advanced countries in battery technology, go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Battery Technology.
Advanced battery technology manufacturing covers the creation of technologically advanced batteries with better design, safety, high energy capacity and more importantly, funding for research. Both commercial and educational institute research facilities are looking for methods to advance battery technology i.e., increasing capacity, reducing charging times, and lowering prices. The ultimate aim is to make available even more affordable batteries that will enable inexpensive grid storage and significantly longer ranges for EVs. 
Concerns over the availability of crucial battery components like cobalt and lithium are driving a need for alternatives to the prevalent lithium-ion chemistry. Some of the top firms working towards this goal include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), among others. 
Advancement in technology means that a country has the means to do better research for more efficient battery technology and designs, better development strategies and modes, and smooth processing and manufacturing facilities. This significantly differs from the countries which can manufacture more batteries than others. Because just manufacturing involves the assembly and creation of a large number of batteries with cheap labor. We will consider the countries in this list which have the highest number of patents, research and funding involved in this field. 
Several countries are key players in the battery tech manufacturing industry and claim a major share of the global market. These countries are home to large battery manufacturers, and often have well-developed supply chains and infrastructure to support the production of batteries on a large scale. Some of the key battery tech manufacturing countries include China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Germany.
The technology that revolutionized the world in terms of batteries was the invention of the lithium-ion battery. John B. Goodenough, an American scientist, developed the first lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery in 1980 using a cobalt oxide cathode. This invention, later in 2019, won Goodenough the Nobel prize in chemistry. His invention proved to be one of the breakthroughs of the 21st century as it allowed the development of handheld electronic devices, gadgets and electric cars. At an age of 100 years, Goodenough is still pushing the boundaries of science by working more energy-efficient and sustainable batteries.
These days, lithium-ion batteries, which have good energy-to-weight ratios, high open circuit voltages, and low self-discharge rates, are the most widely used rechargeable battery types for portable gadgets. These batteries have a long lifespan and are frequently used in consumer gadgets. Asia-Pacific (APAC) leads the lithium-ion battery industry as a result of the growing purchasing power of consumers and higher demand for electric cars. The Asia-Pacific lithium-ion battery recycling market is anticipated to expand to a value of USD 5,047.18 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 22.3% over the course of the forecast period, as stated by data bridge market research.
The next breakthrough in battery tech would be the commercialization of solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries employ solid electrodes with a solid electrolyte composed of ceramics such as oxides, glass, and sulphides, as opposed to traditional lithium batteries, which use liquid and polymer gel electrolytes. These batteries may be recharged up to seven times and have a ten-year lifespan while having a greater energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Toyota Motor is regarded as having the most patents for solid-state batteries. Although solid-state batteries for EVs are not yet commercially available, they are likely to do so starting in 2025. In recent news, QuantumScape started delivering its latest solid-state battery prototypes to its clients.
In the Asia-Pacific region, Chinese firms dominate the electric vehicle (EV) battery market, accounting for 56% of the market share. Several of the ten largest battery manufacturers are based in China. South Korean companies and Japanese firms also have a significant presence in the market. The North American and European blocks are trying to keep up with the Asian manufacturers and researchers to decrease their dependence on them. Technology-wise Japan and the US lead the race with several famous names such as Toyota motors and Panasonic in Japan and QuantumScape, A123 Systems, Enovix, SES AI, and Amprius Tech in the US.
The global battery technology market size is expected to grow from $95.7 billion in 2022 to $136.6 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. The adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles and the increasing usage of wearable devices are responsible for the growth of the battery technology market size. Some other sectors, such as solar and wind energy systems, are also merging and the world is making its way towards environment-friendly energy.

New York, NY --News Direct-- Cortina Health
Dr. Muneeb Shah– known widely in social media as “DermDoctor” or “Doctorly” is the #1 dermatology influencer worldwide. With an ever-increasing number of followers reaching over 20 million across his platforms, Dr. Shah has become a trusted advisor for anyone seeking skincare education and dermatology, by creating content that is as informative as it is entertaining. He is a board-certified dermatologist with a passion for skincare education and improving healthcare access. “DermDoctor” recognizes social media as a powerful tool in bringing healthcare education to millions of people who lack the resources to get it otherwise.
Dr. Shah points out that, “There is a real access issue in the United States with healthcare. In certain areas, you cannot see a dermatologist…so there is a massive gap between patients and medical care that needs to be filled.” It is precisely this gap he seeks to fill, debunking skin-related myths and guiding his online community in their skin and dermatology needs. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of board-certified dermatologists in diagnosing and treating skin conditions and the impactful role teledermatology can play in providing access to proper medical care: “When access to an in-person visit is not feasible, many skin conditions can be diagnosed and treated virtually by a dermatologist with proper data. Pairing Cortina’s next-generation technology with its network of board-certified dermatologists is the innovative solution dermatology patients need. That’s why I am proud to be advising Cortina’s team to improve access.” In addition to bringing attention to a seamless solution for diagnosing and treating skin conditions, Dr. Shah is passionate about minimizing misdiagnosis. A common condition that gets overlooked is rosacea as it typically resembles acne or a sunburn. Dr. Shah and Cortina’s first of many educational assets under the medical content advisor role is an informational YouTube video that can be found on Doctorly, discussing key indicators and treatments for both skin conditions in depth.
Cortina Health is the only all-inclusive teledermatology platform providing patients with access to board-certified dermatologists who diagnose and prescribe personalized compounded medications which are shipped directly to the patient’s door.

12 Countries that Produce the Most Cars in the World,09-Feb-23,In fact Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) one of the oldest car manufacturers  in ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-most-cars-133758295.html,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 12 countries that produce the most cars in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the most cars in the world.
The automotive industry is one of the biggest industries in the world, with the total revenue of the industry easily exceeding $2 trillion with the biggest car companies by revenue primarily driving this growth. While global economic uncertainty persists, according to ING Groep N.V. (NYSE:ING), global car sales will continue to increase in 2023 at a healthy rate of 4%. There are various reasons behind this positive outlook, including more consistent production volumes, delayed demand as a result of accumulated order books and despite global economic uncertainty, there is a certain momentum in several emerging economies which are also among the countries that produce the most cars in the world.
Another reason for higher growth is that the base for the previous two to three years has been quite low as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw reduced demand for automobiles not to mention global supply chain issues which affected production across the world. While 2022 saw a rebound which was well above the record 2020 lows, global passenger sales volumes in the last year are still around 10-15% below what they were in their pre-pandemic peak in 2018-2019. The expectation right now, as data for 2022 is consolidated, is that FY22 passenger car sales will finish 1.1% below 2021.
Currently, car trends across different geographical markets have been quite varied and uneven, with emerging markets having a better year as compared to the U.S. while many European markets have a negative year with some major exceptions. Currently, for 2023, the expectation for the three biggest markets in China, the U.S. and Europe is that growth will be consistent in the low single digits as the semiconductor supply bottleneck is expected to clear up, though that doesn't mean that shortages will completely end and could impact some car manufacturers more than others.
12 countries that produce the most cars in the world

It is clear to anyone following the automotive industry even tangentially, that electric is the future. Most major car companies in the world have already committed to a future with electric cars in a bid to be carbon neutral, including the biggest car company in the world in Volkswagen, which was the first vehicle manufacturer in the world to join the Paris Agreement in 2018, with the company aiming to become completely carbon neutral by 2050. In the last year, the company delivered more than 212,000 cars which was an increase of 158% as compared to 2019 and of these, 134,000 cars were electric battery vehicles. Overall, at the start of 2022, the global electric vehicle fleet amounted to around 16 million cars and accounted for only 1% of the total vehicle fleet globally. In financial year 2022 alone, 10 million additional EV vehicles were registered and this trend is expected to continue in 2023, as markets and governments continue to provide incentives and grants to encourage electric vehicle production, as these countries aim to reduce their contribution to global climate change, one of the biggest issues facing the world right now.
Even though European countries are particularly focused on electric vehicles, according to ING Groep N.V. (NYSE:ING), the U.S. is catching up to Europe and China in this regard. Global registration of battery-powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were 13% of all new registrations in 2022, while this is expected to jump to 15% in 2023. While subsidies and grants have been widely available in many countries, including European nations such as Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands in addition to some of the countries that produce the most cars in the world, many countries are either reducing or phasing out such subsidies which is expected to have a direct impact on the growth rate of electric vehicles.
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the most valuable car company in the world even after a disastrous 2022 where its stock value fell by more than 60%. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered to be the pioneer of electric vehicles because of which it was able to build in incredibly valuable brand despite its car production levels being significantly below other major car producers. In 2022, weak deliveries were one of the reasons why Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its market cap plummet with supply chain issues in China and lower demand by car buyers not helping the case either. Right now, many major automotive manufacturers have made major investments in electric vehicles and are providing stiff competition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).
To determine the countries that produce the most cars in the world, we headed over to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers and only selected car production numbers for 2021 and 2020. We then assigned 70% weightage to 2021 and 30% weightage to 2020, as 2021 is the more relevant year. The 12 biggest car producers in the world account for more than 80% of the total global car production of 55.9 million vehicles in 2021. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the countries dominating one of the biggest industries in the world, starting with:
12. France
Total car production in 2021: 917,907
Total car production in 2020: 927,718
Two of the biggest car companies in the world are French in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) and Renault Group, both of which own really popular car brands. In the first month of 2023, France posted year-on-year growth by 8.8%.
11. Slovakia
Total car production in 2021: 990,598
Total car production in 2020: 1,000,000
While Slovakia established itself as a major hub for car manufacturers with help from German manufacturers. However, the country is facing difficulty in transitioning to electric vehicles even as such cars become more common. The Slovakian government is subsidizing purchases of all-electric vehicles while millions are being invested in developing charging infrastructure, which is a boon to the biggest EV charging companies in the world. Despite all of this, the nation's movement towards e-mobility is still at a very early stage.
10. Czech Republic
Total car production in 2021: 1,105,223
Total car production in 2020: 1,152,901
The automotive industry is one of the most important industries in the Czech Republic, providing employment to over 100,000 people and is also a major contributor to Czech Republic's export sector. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) announced that it would halt production in the Czech Republic in February 2023 because of a parts shortage even as the company increased output in the plant after spending over 180 million euros.
9. Russia
Total car production in 2021: 1,352,740
Total car production in 2020: 1,260,518
In 2022, Russia's car production plummeted to its lowest level since Soviet times directly as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. Car production in the country fell by 67% because of Western sanctions as global car companies closed operations in the country. There is a strong chance that Russia could entirely drop off our list because of continued sanctions as production will continue to suffer. In December 2022, production was just 40,300 units.
8. United States
Total car production in 2021: 1,563,060
Total car production in 2020: 1,924,398
Surprisingly, the United States does not feature very highly in our list of countries that produce the most cars in the world, especially after a major fall in production in 2021 as compared to 2020. Even though the overall number of cars produced by the U.S. is already low, it has fallen considerably in 2021, mainly because of the shortage of microchips, which affect not just electric or hybrid vehicles, but internal combustion engine cars as well, which still make up the majority of vehicles. Further, there is a strong focus in the U.S. on trucks and SUVs as opposed to passenger cars, which is also why the U.S. lags so far behind other countries in this respect. U.S. car production has been on a downwards spiral for around half a century now as many of its biggest companies have moved factories to other countries such as Mexico to take advantage of lower labor cost and taxes.
However, because it is the most populated developed country in the world, where the average disposable income is quite high, its influence in the automotive industry is quite high. In fact, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), one of the oldest car manufacturers in the world, is credited for introducing large-scale manufacturing plants and methods which were used by companies in countries across the world. Another major car company in the U.S. is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) which currently has a market cap of over $57 billion. The U.S. has launched green subsidy schemes which has resulted in Germany calling on Europe to deploy similar strategies to counter competition from U.S. in this respect.
7. Spain
Total car production in 2021: 1,662,174
Total car production in 2020: 1,800,664
European countries have a strong presence in our list and Spain is the second-largest European car manufacturer. The vast majority of car production in Spain is to cater to exports, with over a dozen car factories located in the country. Currently, the industry is in dire need of an overhaul in terms of catching up to other European nations in the electrification process. Meanwhile, a slow recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic slump, semiconductor shortages and temporary factory closures have seen its production slow down significantly in 2021 as compared to the previous year.
6. Brazil
Total car production in 2021: 1,707,851
Total car production in 2020: 1,607,175
Brazil is a huge market for cars, which is why while it doesn't have many major car companies apart from Agrale, most of the major global car companies have a strong presence in the country which is why it ranks quite highly in our list.

Now, 99 years later, the tables have turned.
Spurred by global supply chain disruptions, mounting geopolitical tensions, and a high-stakes technological competition with China, the US is investing heavily in rebuilding its domestic industrial base. This comes after decades of outsourcing production abroad, which hollowed out manufacturing capabilities at home.
That’s why Ford now needs China’s help.
“Entering the US at a curve”
Ford this week announced it will build a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan, using technology licensed from the Chinese battery giant CATL.
“Reality is the US needs the expertise of China to offer low-cost [lithium-iron-phosphate] battery cells, and therefore cheaper EVs,” noted Henry Sanderson, executive editor of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “[It’s a] reverse technology transfer, reflecting China’s big headstart in the energy transition.”
For CATL, the world’s largest EV battery company with 37% of the global market as of 2022, the technology licensing deal with Ford grants it an important foothold in the US market.
While CATL has aggressively expanded its production footprint in Europe, it has yet to open a factory in the US. Robin Zeng, CATL’s founder, said last February (link in Chinese) that the company “will definitely enter the US market.” One year later, CATL has found a way in.
Chinese media reports describe CATL’s partnership with Ford as a strategic move with potentially huge returns in the long run. Ford will have 100% ownership of the new EV plant, while CATL will earn licensing and service fees from sharing its technical know-how.
“CATL is entering the US market at a curve...[its entry] has more strategic significance than commercial value,” wrote the Chinese business news outlet Huxiu (link in Chinese).
Motoring past spy planes and spy balloons
The Ford-CATL tie-up has another echo from recent business history, too.
In 2001, Ford snagged a foothold in the Chinese market by establishing a 50-50 joint venture with the Chinese state-owned carmaker Changan Auto. That deal was sealed at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions: A US spy plane had just collided with a Chinese fighter jet.
The contemporary parallel involves another airborne surveillance object: Ford and CATL’s agreement comes amid a continuing diplomatic crisis over a Chinese spy balloon that the US shot down last week.
Ford’s deals with Changan Auto and CATL, in spite of spy plane and spy balloon incidents, might highlight how commercial interests often override geopolitical concerns.
US senator Marco Rubio, however, is demanding an official review of Ford and CATL’s licensing agreement, saying the deal “will only deepen US reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for battery tech.” Beijing is also reportedly seeking a review to safeguard CATL’s core technology.
So geopolitics might get in the way after all.

OEMs are upgrading the battery packs of EVs to enhance the miles driven on a single charge. For instance, Tesla plans to improve the battery pack (100-kilowatt-hour) in its EVs. Similarly, the Nissan Leaf is improving its battery pack to enhance the miles driven on a single charge. Thus, the increasing average miles driven on a single charge will attract more customers, which will drive the demand for EV motors during the forecast period.
Major challenges - The lack of operational infrastructure in emerging markets is challenging market growth. There is a lack of efficient charging infrastructure for EVs, especially in emerging markets. In addition, road infrastructure is inadequate in these countries, which hinders the wide-scale expansion of EV charging infrastructure. Though governing bodies are developing charging stations, most of them are slow-charging stations and require a considerable amount of time to charge. Thus, the lack of operational infrastructure is expected to impede the overall growth of the market during the forecast period.

The Global EV Industry: An Analysis
The global electric vehicle (EV) industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by increasing demand for clean and efficient transportation, along with government incentives and supportive policies. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global EV industry was valued at $208.58 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a value of $1.10 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 23.1% over the forecasted period.
The rapid growth of the EV industry is attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, with advancements in battery technology, battery costs are falling and making EVs more affordable and accessible to consumers. As EVs have become more affordable and are now being viewed as a more eco-friendly and viable alternative to their ICE-powered rivals, EV adoption has accelerated across the globe. Moreover, governments around the world are focused on reducing carbon emissions and so have implemented measures to increase the demand for electric vehicles. In recent years, governments have announced numerous incentives and subsidies, to both EV makers and consumers, in order to incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles. According to Precedence Research, the United States, China and Europe have all seen a considerable rise in electric vehicle sales in recent years, and this trajectory is expected to continue over the forecasted period.
By propulsion type, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) held the largest revenue share of the global EV industry, roughly 67%,  in 2022. However, the plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) segment is expected to grow at a relatively faster compound annual growth rate, an estimated 43.5%, over the forecasted period primarily due to the cost benefits that PHEVs have over BEVs. Moreover, PHEVs also cater to diverse users' needs since they can be refilled at a gas station as well as charged at a charging point. Finally, the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) segment is expected to record the fastest growth rate over the forecasted period due to hefty investments being poured by both governments and organizations to advance the technology.
Overall, the global EV industry is on track to become a trillion dollar industry by 2030. By investing in EV stocks, investors can capitalize on the secular growth trends of this booming industry. Some of the most prominent players that are leading the global EV industry include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). However, for the purposes of this article, we will focus on the most promising EV stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts.

“Consumer Discretionary investments along with the lack of exposure to the strong performing Energy sector offset a portion of the above-mentioned gains. Within Consumer Discretionary, the underperformance of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) coupled with lower exposure to this better performing sector hampered relative results. Rivian’s shares fell as investors fretted over the company’s unit economics and how macroeconomic uncertainty is impacting the EV industry.
Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an EV manufacturer producing vehicles for the consumer and corporate delivery van markets. Its shares were under pressure during the quarter. Investors remained focused on the company’s execution challenges, the implied unit economics for its vehicles, and near-term headwinds for the automotive industry stemming from a weaker global economy. Despite these headwinds, we are comfortable with Rivian’s liquidity position and its competitive position within the EV industry, which we believe will continue to grow at impressive rates. Rivian should also benefit from its positive product reviews, its integrated technology approach, and its industry partnerships.”
In addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is also well-positioned to capture further market share of the EV industry due to its innovative and cutting-edge vehicles.

New car prices push higher as used prices keep slipping,14-Feb-23,Yahoo Finance. New car prices push higher as used vehicle prices ... Ford  Motor Company Chief Executive Bill Ford announces Ford will partner...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-car-prices-push-higher-as-used-vehicle-prices-keep-slipping-161627155.html,"It was a mixed picture for the U.S. auto market as prices overall ticked up slightly month over month in January.
The BLS reported in its January CPI report that new vehicle prices rose 0.2% (up 5.8% year-over-year)and used vehicle prices fell 1.9%, (down 11.6% y-o-y). While used prices have fallen for seven straight months, new car prices have steadily risen every month since March 2021 (based on revised CPI numbers).
January’s CPI data mirrored what most recent auto market data has been showing in recent months. Kelley Blue Book reports new car prices rose 5.9% versus a year ago, which has moderated somewhat, but the market share for luxury vehicles hit a new record in January (19.6% of the overall market). No surprise: the Cox Automotive/Moody’s affordability index found that the typical car payment for a new car in December, the latest data available, hit an estimated record of $777 a month.

Conversely, used car market prices as measured by Manheim’s wholesale used car price index fell 12.8% versus a year ago in January; however, prices did climb slightly by 2.5% month over month. This slight uptick in used car prices created some fear that inflation was perking back up in the market as measured by wholesale prices. But another reason for this: used car dealers may have been buying up supply ahead of the spring buying season, which is usually brisk because of factors like tax refunds.
Nonetheless, the trend seems to be that the red hot used car market of the pandemic is continuing to soften, whereas the new car market continues pushing higher.
Meanwhile, automakers like GM (GM) and Ford (F) are making fewer cars than they were pre-pandemic, but are seeing profits rise as margins increase. While the trend of higher new car prices will moderate over time, the automakers have discovered that they prefer to sell fewer higher-priced cars, and tack on high-margin offerings like software features and other services to boost the bottom line.
This means fewer cars in inventory for dealers, which helps avoid selling leftovers at reduced prices.
“We're committed to actively managing production levels to balance supply with demand and our targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory on a portfolio basis,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in last quarter’s earnings conference call. Jacobson said this figure is 20 to 30 days below pre-pandemic levels.

The silver lining for consumers is that new car prices are expected to moderate, eventually, as automakers look to increase inventory at the dealer level as the component and chip crisis wanes—and competition heats up. Ford CFO John Lawler said the automaker expects new car prices to fall “around 5%” this year as higher incentives pull prices lower.
Buyers looking to purchase a new car are hoping for that result. But if inflation remains stubborn, and the Fed decides to keep rates high leading to higher financing costs, buyers will have no choice but to seek better deals on the used car lots.

Amazon's Zoox tests robotaxi on public road with employees ...,13-Feb-23,Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG last fall announced they would shutter  their ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-zoox-tests-robotaxi-public-180301393.html,"By Abhirup Roy
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's self-driving vehicle unit, Zoox, said on Monday it has successfully tested a robotaxi with employees as passengers on a public road in a move to bring it closer to commercial service for the general public.
The Feb. 11 test, conducted between two Zoox buildings a mile apart at its headquarters in Foster City, California, was part of the launch of a no-cost employee shuttle service that will also help the company refine its technology.
""Putting the vehicle on (an) open public road and validating our approach to all of the different requirements, including regulatory, is a big step and we would not have done it unless internally we were already looking at the line of sight for going commercial,"" Chief Executive Aicha Evans told reporters on a conference call.
Evans declined to provide a timeline for the commercial launch, which will need additional government clearances.
The industry's automated vehicle segment has not rolled out as fast as originally expected as the technology has proven tough to master. Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG last fall announced they would shutter their Argo AI self-driving unit and focus on driver-assistance technology that provided more immediate returns.
Companies still pursuing development of this technology include General Motors Co's Cruise unit and Alphabet Inc's Waymo.
Zoox's robotaxi - built as a fully autonomous vehicle from scratch rather than retrofitting existing cars for self-driving - comes without a steering wheel or pedals and has room for four passengers, with two facing each other.
Online retailer Amazon, which has been aggressively expanding into self-driving technology, bought Zoox for $1.3 billion in 2020.
But rapid interest rate hikes and weak consumer demand sparked fears of a global recession, forcing many companies, including automakers and tech giants, to trim their workforcesand claw back costs.
Zoox's tech chief, Jesse Levinson, said the company has been prudent about its growth but was still on track to reach 2,500 employees this year, up from just under 2,000 employees at the beginning of the year.

The global heavy trucks market will grow from $208.31 billion in 2022 to $222.57 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%.

S&P Global Inc., a financial information and analytics company, indicated that global sales of heavy-duty trucks will decline by 20% to 30% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 impact.

Lucid sees disappointing 2023 EV production as orders drop ...,22-Feb-23,Price cuts by Tesla and Ford Motor Co have made it harder for rivals such  as ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lucid-expects-least-10-000-210637167.html,"(This Feb. 22 story has been corrected to change period to third quarter from second quarter in paragraph 8)
By Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy
(Reuters) - Lucid Group Inc on Wednesday forecast 2023 production well short of analysts' expectations and reported a major drop in orders during the fourth quarter amid weakening demand, sending the electric carmaker's shares down 11% after hours.
The Newark, California-based company, which was already battling supply chain and logistics issues and struggling to deliver cars, was hit by aggressive price cuts sparked by Tesla Inc that lured consumers away from its luxury cars amid rising interest rates and soaring inflation.
""There's a lot more competition than a year ago ... a lot more EVs becoming available at lower price points than the Lucid Air vehicle,"" said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research. ""There's probably a lot of frustration from customers having to wait for so long to get the vehicles they ordered.""
Lucid said it expects to produce 10,000 to 14,000 luxury electric vehicles this year. Analysts on average expected the company to make 21,815 cars, according to Visible Alpha.
The company, backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Public Investment Fund, delivered 4,369 cars last year, far below the 7,180 units it produced.
""We've gotten past the major bottlenecks limiting manufacturing, but this had some impact on the demand we generated early on, and this has been exacerbated by the challenging macroeconomic environment,"" Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said on a call with analysts, after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed expectations.
Price cuts by Tesla and Ford Motor Co have made it harder for rivals such as Rivian Automotive Inc and Lucid to grab share in an industry competing for shrinking consumer wallets.
Lucid said it had more than 28,000 orders as of Feb. 21, down 6,000 reservations from the third quarter, after it delivered about 1,900 vehicles and saw cancellations. That was despite Lucid's offering a discount of $7,500 on Feb. 9 for purchases of certain variants of the Air sedan before March 31.
Finance chief Sherry House said Lucid would not publish quarterly reservation numbers going ahead.
This year, the company will focus on improving production and deliveries, and will take a ""vigorous and comprehensive"" look at driving down operating and manufacturing costs.
House said Lucid would incur capital expenditures of between $1.5 billion and $1.75 billion in 2023. That's a 40% jump from 2022, but well below analysts' expectations of $2.24 billion.
Lucid reported a cash balance of $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, after raising $1.52 billion in December. At the end of the third quarter, it had $1.26 billion in cash reserves.
Revenue rose to $257.7 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $26.4 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected sales of $302.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's net loss narrowed to $472.6 million, or 28 cents per share, from a loss of $1.05 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.
Shares of Lucid fell as much 10.6% in extended trading. The stock fell 82% last year after Lucid halved its production forecast due to supply chain issues.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-pay-attention-equity-140001930.html,"equity stake
Equity stake refers to the amount of ownership of a company owned by a person, organization or group of owners. It's usually expressed in percentage terms, with 100% equity stake indicating complete ownership. Owning an equity stake in a company gives an investor a measure of control over the business. The control is typically proportional to the percentage of ownership, with more than 50% equivalent to more or less absolute control. Equity stake and control can be diluted if more shares are issued. Some special types of shares can also give effective control to minority shareholders. To learn how equities can play a role in your investment portfolio, you may consider talking to a financial advisor.
Equity Stake Defined
Equity is the term used to describe how much a company is worth after subtracting debts and other liabilities. Buying ownership in a company is referred to as taking an equity stake.
When an investor buys shares of a publicly traded company, they are taking an equity stake. Private equity firms do the same when they invest in privately held companies in exchange for a portion of the ownership. Sometimes lenders may agree to accept an equity stake in return for forgiving part of a company's debts.
Otherwise, however, lending is distinct from ownership and having control is one example of that. Lenders normally have limited rights to influence a company's strategies, policies and operations. Having an equity stake, however, generally implies some ability to have input into business decisions.
How Equity Affects Ownership and Control
equity stake
The control that goes with owning equity can take different forms. In the case of a public company, owning equity comes with voting rights usually equal to the number of shares the equity holder owns. The larger the percentage of equity owned by a single investor, the larger their control. Investors with an equity stake in a public company can exercise their control when they vote on propositions put before shareholders at a public company's annual meeting. One share usually provides one vote.
These propositions often include electing members to the board, although other matters such as compensation plans may also be on the ballot. More detailed decisions, such as introducing new products, are not usually put before shareholders. So an equity stake in a public company gives control only over big-picture matters determined by the board.
Private equity stakeholders can have other arrangements. Often, private equity investors will require controlling ownership of a majority of shares before investing in a private company. Venture capitalists may have special powers such as the right to appoint board members.
Limits of Equity Stake Influence
In some cases, public companies can be set up so that owners of minority equity stakes have a controlling interest. This may be done through special classes of shares that have expanded voting rights.
Ford Motor Company is one example. The automaker has special Class B shares restricted to members of the Ford family. These shares together represent 40% of the voting rights, although they represent only 2% of the company's total outstanding stock.
While 40% is not outright majority ownership, when voting together the Class B owners can reliably impose their collective will on holders of common shares with no special voting rights. This makes the company effectively family-controlled, although the family's actual equity stake is a very small percentage.
Activist investors sometimes purchase significant equity stakes in public companies in order to influence company activities. They may be able to exert sizable influence, including getting board members elected, by having ownership stakes of less than 10% if they can convince other shareholders to go along.
Activists may then seek to have the company take specific actions, such as selling off divisions or putting the entire company up for sale or pursuing specific environmental or other objectives. Sometimes when this happens, as a defensive measure a company will issue additional shares in an attempt to dilute the activist equity stake and preserve independence. A poison pill is one defensive tactic employing this approach.
The Bottom Line
equity stake
Buying an equity stake in a company gives an investor some control over the business. Equity stakeholders can influence public company decision-making by casting votes at annual meetings, with each share normally representing one vote. For most shareholders of public companies, the amount of ownership control is very small because of the sheer number of shares, which may number in the hundreds of millions. Only large institutional shareholders can generally wield much influence over most public companies. Private equity firms may enjoy majority control and essentially unhampered ability to influence the companies they choose for investing.

IDTechEx Discuss Why Immersion Cooling Might Not be the ...,23-Feb-23,Where Will Ford's Stock Price Be in 2024? 4h ago. Motley Fool. 2 Blue Chip  Stocks ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/idtechex-discuss-why-immersion-cooling-141200439.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Battery thermal management is a critical component to an electric vehicles (EVs) operation. Cells need to be kept cool when under load from driving and charging or kept warm during cold ambient conditions. This enables more efficient operation of the batteries and improves safety. This is typically done via a water cold plate at the base of the battery pack or via water coolant channels between the cells. Immersion cooling is often touted as the next-generation thermal management technology, but there are certainly barriers to adoption. Based on IDTechEx's latest research report, ""Thermal Management for Electric Vehicles 2023-2033"", this article looks at the benefits, drawbacks, current market adoption, and potential for the future.
EV immersion cooling sees gaining market share and increased fluid demand over this decade. Source: IDTechEx
Benefits
As the name suggests, immersion cooling involves having the battery cells directly immersed in a dielectric fluid. The immediate benefit is the superior thermal contact and homogeneity; the fluid contacts much more of the cell directly than a cold plate or coolant channel would, helping eliminate a non-uniform temperature gradient. Depending on the fluid used, it can act to extinguish a fire in the event of thermal runaway.
Not so obviously, immersion can lead to the removal of several components, such as the cold plate, thermal interface materials, condenser, and chiller.
The more effective thermal management helps enable fast charging, an often publicized factor for selling an EV.
Drawbacks
The initial concern for most is the weight of the fluids. This is certainly true for heavy hydrofluoroether products that often have densities above 1.5g/cm3. However, this can be mitigated somewhat by removing other components (as above) or the use of other types of dielectric fluids like synthetic esters or other oil mixtures with a density below that of water (1g/cm3). The argument is complicated by the need for enough space between the cells for fluid flow; this may not directly impact weight but could reduce the volumetric energy density of the pack.
Dielectric fluids used in this application typically have a greatly reduced thermal conductivity and specific heat than water-glycol. This means a higher fluid flow rate may be required; couple this with fluids that are sometimes more viscous than water and have different chemical compatibility, and this leads to a greater requirement on the fluid pumps and coolant hoses/seals. Speaking of which, typical battery modules are not designed to contain fluid; therefore, the modules have to be redesigned to avoid leakage and ensure no corrosion takes place.
Who Is Using It?
Immersion cooling in EVs has remained quite limited over the past few years. Early implementation has occurred in a few market segments, including high-performance hybrids such as McLaren and plans for Mercedes AMG in the future, relatively niche luxury battery electric vehicles like Rimac and Faraday Future, and construction equipment through companies such as XING Mobility and John Deere. A factor these segment share is the need for a very power-dense battery but not necessarily a very energy dense one (for hybrids and construction).
The above applications have focused on single-phase immersion cooling, but players like Carrar are focusing on two-phase, suggesting that it can provide even better thermal performance, lower amounts of fluid, and lower system pressure. However, two-phase immersion is certainly at a lower state of deployment in EVs today.
There has been a much bigger push on the material supplier side, with several existing material companies producing fluids for these applications and creating partnerships to further develop the technology. This has been seen with players like Castrol partnering with XING Mobility and FUCHS Lubricants partnering with Exoes. However, 3M have announced the halt of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) by 2025, including its Novec fluid used for immersion applications.
Where Will It Be Used?
Immersion cooling certainly proposes significant benefits to the EV market. IDTechEx sees the immediate benefits for power dense applications, such as high-performance hybrids, motorsport, and construction. Luxury high-performance vehicles do not have to contend with high volume manufacturing scales and also present a good immediate opportunity for immersion. For greater adoption into the mass-market automotive sector, a much more serious overhaul of the status quo would be required. Water-glycol cold plates are a proven technology that has demonstrated high charging powers. Given automotive development timescales IDTechEx is not expecting significant immersion deployment in the near future but sees a greater opportunity later into this decade with a 9-fold yearly fluid demand increase between 2026 and 2033, but remaining a relatively small part of the overall automotive thermal management market.
IDTechEx's report, ""Thermal Management for Electric Vehicles 2023-2033"", takes a deep dive into immersion cooling, looking at the benefits, drawbacks, current adoption, and future adoption with 10-year market forecasts. Fluids from several material players are benchmarked against each other in terms of thermal performance, mechanical properties, and costs. The report also covers the thermal management landscape for EVs more generally, looking at battery, motor, and power electronics and the trends associated with each component.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is largely controlled by ...,28-Feb-23,Yahoo · Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is largely controlled by institutional  shareholders who own 55% of the company.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-nyse-f-120040357.html,"Key Insights
Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Ford Motor's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownership
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
If you want to know who really controls Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 55% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Ford Motor.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Ford Motor. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ford Motor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Ford Motor. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.7% and 6.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Ford Motor Company. Insiders own US$640m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Ford Motor. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Ford Motor that you should be aware of.

With the increasing shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), the global demand for batteries has seen major amounts of growth. According to the Wall Street Journal, the global sales of electric vehicles reached around 7.8 million which accounted for around 10% of the total auto sales for the year. The number of electric vehicles sold in 2022 saw a 68% increase from 2021 according to research from LMC Automotive and EV-Volumes.com. Meanwhile, the market share of electric vehicles was 11% of total car sales in Europe and 19% of total car sales in China. However, when plug-in hybrid vehicles which also have a small combustion engine are taken into account, the market share of electric vehicles in Europe increases to 20.3%. While the share of completely electric vehicles in the United States was lower at 5.8% in 2022, it was still a major jump from 3.2% in 2021.
The increase in market share for electric vehicles is projected to continue. According to a report prepared by BloombergNEF, the market share of electric vehicles is projected to reach 40% by 2030. This rise is directly correlated with a projected increase in battery manufacturing. Atlas Public Policy has estimated that the investments in battery manufacturing in the United States alone reached $73 billion in 2022 which was three times as high as the investments in 2021. BloombergNEF also pointed out this trend in the rise of battery manufacturing, citing a 38% rise in battery manufacturing capacity since 2021.
While the investments in battery manufacturing have been global, the market is still dominated by China. The New York Times estimates that China produces about 75% of all electric vehicle battery cells and does more refining of the major raw inputs than every other country in the world combined. It also had more electric vehicles sold than the rest of the world combined along with exports of electric vehicles rising to $3.2 billion in worth by November 2022. The country has 5 of the largest EV battery makers in the world according to market share.
These battery manufacturers dominate the market, with the top 10 battery manufacturers accounting for more than 90% of the market share while the top 5 battery manufacturing companies account for around 75% of the total market share. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the top six players in the cell manufacturing market will continue to dominate the market shares through 2030, when they will have a projected 61% market share despite a much larger market with more producers. The report also predicts that the total addressable market for batteries will grow to 2.8 TWh by 2030. While the production of batteries increases, it is also projected that battery prices will decrease due to the introduction of battery innovations that aim on reducing the costs of production via more efficient processes as well as cheaper outputs. Like other battery and automotive manufacturers such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), the battery manufacturers listed below are revolutionizing the automotive industry today.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Ford is driving on a rocky road, from production halts to a cost disadvantage of $7 to $8 billion. And the automaker continues on its route towards the EV revolution, but does Ford have the fuel to make it through to its EV goals? Here to discuss this and more is Garrett Nelson, CFRA VP and Equity Analyst, along with Yahoo Finance's own Pras Subramanian. Thank you for joining me, Garrett.
So we know you have a buy rating on Ford, a 12-month price target of $17. It does have a lot of pros going for it-- valuation, demand, reinstated its dividends. But when you look at things like cost, when you look at things like the operational issues, what is going to get it to that price target?
GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, thanks for having me. You know, Ford has quietly become the second bestselling US EV manufacturer. They're a distant second to Tesla. But still, they've done a lot better than many of their peers. And so we think that's a big part of the growth story going forward. We know the F-150 Lightning electric pickup is available. The reservation count is north of 200,000 units for that vehicle. And they've had a lot of success with the Mustang Mach-E and other EVs that they've put out. So-- but still, there's a lot of work to be done.
As you noted, Jim Farley took the CEO reins almost 2 and 1/2 years ago. And I think there's some frustration that they're not really turning the corner as fast as a lot of investors would like. They did double their dividend last year. The stock is yielding roughly 6% here on that dividend. But I think there's still a lot of work to be done. When you look at Ford's global footprint and their employee count, we think there's still a lot of room for improvement. And so Farley really has his work cut out for him still.
PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Garrett. So Ford's last two quarters were a little disappointing for investors. Had some issues here with the EV transformation. They're really going hard with the splitting of the company up. The Ford Lightning with some issues with the batteries and the ongoing recall issues with other vehicles. Is the transformation stalling there for the company? Is it more of a short-term thing, or are there long-term issues here?
GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, we think it's more of a short-term thing. You know, Ford's not the only one that's had battery issues. In fact, we put out a report a couple of weeks ago looking at the really frustratingly slow pace of EV production rampup of the likes of General Motors has had problems with their battery for the Bolt, now Ford's having problems with the F-150 Lightning. But you look at some of the smaller EV manufacturers like Lucid and Rivian, their production rampups have been very disappointing.
And so we think it's more of a near-term problem. But really, the only automaker, in our view, in the US that has mastered the mass market EV production is Tesla, really. They really have it down to a science. And it's going to be, we think, a bumpy road for a lot of the traditional automakers, who, of course, have been producing internal combustion engine vehicles for many, many decades. But EVs, that's a whole new ballgame. And so there's a lot of adjustments. There's going to be a lot of growing pains, we think.
PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You mentioned Jim Farley on the job for about 2 and 1/2 years now in the CEO seat. You know, he's an operator. He's a car guy. Wall Street applauded his promotion to the CEO role. Is he still the right guy for the job, given what Ford is doing? This is a big transformation and a huge turn for the business.
GARRETT NELSON: I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, that's the question everyone is asking. There's been a lot of frustration. The stock price, you know, after a big runup really in the year or so after he took the reins, has really stalled. Part of it was because Ford's production and earnings were rebounding from the depths of COVID in 2020. But now is really-- he's going to really have to show some improvement here.
Part of the plan is to separate the electric business from the internal combustion engine vehicle business. We do think they're following the right strategy by taking a more balanced approach towards EV growth and really focusing on building excitement surrounding individual EV models, as opposed to setting a date in the future in which they're going to be all-electric. We think the balanced approach is the right one, just given the fact that EVs still accounted for less than 6% of all US new vehicle sales last year. Clearly, EVs are the future of the industry. But growth is going to take several years.
RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as we look at Europe-- because they did set targets there in terms of where they want to be all-electric. They've also announced about 3,000 job cuts there, really trying to streamline some of the range of the products they have out there as well. What else do you think is going to make Ford more competitive in the EV space?
GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, it's really just building excitement surrounding individual models. They want to be able to offer electric versions of certain models, such as the Bronco hybrid version, and then all-gas versions. So we think giving consumers those kinds of choices as far as what they want to-- what they want to purchase is really going to be beneficial to them.
So-- but, you know, he took over at a time where we felt there was a lot of low-hanging fruit in terms of operational improvement that they can make. He's made some progress. But I think a lot of investors didn't have an appreciation for how difficult-- what a massive global footprint that Ford has. And really, improvement is going to be have to-- is going to have to be made across all geographies. And so I think after 2 and 1/2 years, a lot of investors are thinking they would be further along. So really, there's a lot of pressure on Farley, and he's going to really have to show some execution here in the coming quarters.","{'negative': 0.8177956193685532, 'neutral': 0.8228023132452598, 'positive': 0.8184231244600736}",0.8228023132452598,0.8184231244600736,0.8177956193685532

Stock market sectors guide: How these 11 slices of the market ...,03-Mar-23,Some of the best-known companies: Amazon Ford Motor Company Home Depot  ...

If you’re a stock market investor and want to broadly diversify your portfolio, you’ll need to own stock in companies across many different parts of the economy. The economy can be broken down into sectors, which group stocks with similar business characteristics together. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors, composed of 25 industry groups and 74 industries, as of March 2023. The commonly-used system helps shape how ETFs and mutual funds are constructed.
Here’s how GICS works and its 11 sector classifications, including some top companies in each.
What is the GICS system and why is it important?
The GICS system forms the basis for how groups of companies are divided and subdivided, and that division ultimately impacts how many sector-based index funds are created and which companies are included and left out of any given index. The classification system shapes that decision. GICS was developed in 1999 by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s, two giants in the financial industry.
The classification system gets fairly granular, and includes the following groupings in descending order of size:
Sectors
Industry groups
Industries
Sub-industries
The GICS system is revised from time to time, especially as industries grow and develop. For example, real estate is the newest addition to the sector categorization. Real estate companies and REITs were moved from the financials sector to their own separate sector in 2016. The move was due to the increasing growth and importance of real estate, especially equity REITs.
This move helped recognize the development of the real estate sector as not just a financial player, and the reclassification had a powerful impact on the sector, driving more money to the stocks of those companies. Large fund companies that managed index-based funds had to buy more of these real estate stocks in order to match the new weightings in the sector index.
So it’s a big deal when the GICS classification changes or a company is added to or removed from the schema. The move could cause significant buying or selling of affected stocks, and may even change the company’s ability to access cheaper funding.
One alternative to the GICS schema is the Industry Classification Benchmark, or ICB. The ICB was developed in 2005 by Dow Jones and FTSE, and divides the market into 11 industries, 20 supersectors and then further into sectors and subsectors. It’s now used by the NASDAQ, NYSE and other international markets.
11 sectors of the stock market
Below are the 11 GICS sector classifications, including a description of the companies in the sector, as well as a few of the largest or most well-known companies. Also included is a popular index fund that allows you to invest in the sector with a low expense ratio.
1. Energy
The energy sector includes companies engaged in exploration and production of oil and other hydrocarbons, refining, the transportation of oil and gas, and production of oil and gas equipment. The sector is generally mature with modest growth.
Some of the best-known companies: Chevron, ExxonMobil, Halliburton
Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE)
2. Materials
The materials sector includes companies that produce chemicals, glass, paper, forestry products, metals, packaging, construction materials and steel. It tends to be a mature industry with modest growth potential.
Some of the best-known companies: Dow, DuPont, Sherwin-Williams
Popular sector ETF: iShares Global Materials ETF (MXI)
3. Industrials
The industrials sector includes companies that manufacture aerospace and defense products, electrical equipment and construction equipment.

4. Consumer discretionary
The consumer discretionary sector includes companies that produce cars, durable goods, clothing and leisure equipment. It also includes restaurants, hotels and consumer retailing, among others.

Some of the best-known companies: Amazon, Ford Motor Company, Home Depot
Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR)
5. Consumer staples
The consumer staples sector includes companies that produce food, drinks and tobacco, and non-durable household goods as well as those retailers that sell food and drugs, including retailing supercenters. This industry tends to be mature with modest growth.

Some of the best-known companies: Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth
Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT)
7. Financials
The financials sector consists of companies involved in banking, including mortgage and consumer finance, as well as investment banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)
9. Communication services
The communication services sector includes telecommunication and media companies, entertainment companies and those producing content and interactive games.

Some of the best-known companies: Disney, Meta Platforms, Verizon
Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX)
10. Utilities
The utilities sector includes companies providing electricity, gas and water (from conventional and environmentally friendly sources) as well as energy traders and distributors of energy. This sector is generally a slow and steady performer, rather than a growth sector. But “green” energy offers the promise of higher returns, although with higher risk.
Some of the best-known companies: Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, NextEra Energy
Popular sector ETF: Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU)
11. Real estate
The real estate sector includes real estate services companies, real estate developers and equity REITs. This sector may offer strong growth opportunities, but shows steady growth overall.
Some of the best-known companies: American Tower, Public Storage, Simon Property Group
Popular sector ETF: Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (VNQ)
Bottom line
Understanding where a company fits into the sector classification can be helpful as you diversify your portfolio and include companies from a broad range of sectors. Also, it’s important to remember that larger companies often may span multiple sectors or industries. While a firm may be classified in one area, it often has significant operations in others. So it can be important to see the big picture of what a company does and not get too tied down to the classification.","{'negative': 0.7900915344556173, 'neutral': 0.894129713928258, 'positive': 0.7944294148021274}",0.894129713928258,0.7944294148021274,0.7900915344556173

William Li: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2022 Q4 earnings conference. In Q4, 2022, NIO delivered a total of 40,052 smart electric vehicles, up 60% year-over-year, achieving a new quarterly record. According to the retail data released by CATRC, China Automotive Technology and Research Center, NIO was the best-selling brand in China's premium EV market, priced over RMB 300,000 with a market share of 54.8%, while over market share in the premium EV market priced over RMB 400,000 reached 75.8%. In 2022, despite the impact posed by COVID and supply chain disruptions, NIO delivered a total of 122,486 smart electric vehicles, up 34% year-over-year. In January and February of 2023, we delivered 20,663 vehicles, representing a 30.89% increase year-over-year.
We expect the total deliveries in the first quarter of this year to be between 31,000 and 33,000 units. As the penetration rate of the premium EV growth and more NIO products is expected to be delivered in the second quarter, we have a strong confidence in the market demand in 2023. Next, I would like to share some recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations. Since we started to deliver ET5 in September 2022, it's the production and delivery has been ramping up steadily. According to CATARC's retail data, this January, among all the mid-size sedans priced over RMB 300,000, NIO ET5 outperformed popular internal combustion vehicles from well-established brands and became the top-selling model in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other 15 cities in China and the second best-selling model nationwide in China.
On December 24, 2022, we held NIO Day 2022 in Hefei, where we launched the smart electric flagship coupe SUV EC7 and all-round flagship SUV, the All-New ES8. EC7 is a large-sized coupe SUV that encourage NIO's high-performance DNA and delivers ultimate handling and the riding experience. The delivery of EC7 is expected to start in May. As NIO's flagship SUV based on the technology platform 2.0, the six seater All-new ES8 offers two seat layouts, catering to all scenarios including work, family, social, and exploration. The delivery of the All-new ES8 is expected to start in June, both new products have attracted wide attention and received great feedback. In the first half of this year, NIO will gradually launch more new products and shortened the waiting time for our launch to user delivery.
Other supply chain and manufacturing teams have been preparing for new product launches and production ramp-up, making sure that supply and production go hand-in-hand with the growing demand for the new product. For intelligent driving, NIO has gradually rolled out NOP+ Beta to all NT2.0 vehicles. Based on our full stack in-house developed intelligent driving technologies and the closed-loop data management. NOP+ Beta has realized significant improvements in areas of a sense of reassurance, comfort, and efficiency. The utilization rate has doubled with a total engaged mileage of over 1.75 million kilometers in the recent week. We plan to roll out more features and functions to our users and will gradually release power swap pallet for highway in the first half of this year.
With respect to the sales and service network, we now have 375 NIO houses and NIO spaces in 141 cities and 305 NIO service centers and NIO delivery centers in 148 cities. In terms of the charging and swapping network, NIO has installed a total of 1,331 power swap stations and provided over 18 million battery swap for our users. In the meantime, NIO has accumulatively deployed 60,385 power chargers and 7,558 destination chargers sent over power map has been connected to over 1.04 million third-party charges. In 2022, 50% of the power charged by our users is from battery swapping stations, which has become the most convenient and favorite solution among new users. In 2023, NIO will speed up the development of the battery swapping network and plan to install additional 1,000 power swap stations.
By the end of 2023, there will be more than 3,000 -- 2,000 to 3,000 power swap stations in total. So far, the mass production of power swap station 3.0 is going forward smoothly with large-scale production expected to start in April, the accelerated deployment of power swap stations can not only provide existing users with experiences beyond expectations, but also significantly boost user demand. In Q4 2022, NIO started to offer NT2.0 products and comprehensive services in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. NIO products have been highly recognized by professional media in Europe, and the user satisfaction rate has also reached off expectations. After obtaining the prestigious Golden Steering Wheel award, ET7 was honored with multiple awards in Europe, such as the Technological Front-Runner of the Year at the Danish Auto Awards, Car of the Year and The Best in the Luxury segment by Auto Motor Sport, Sweden and the Promise of 2023 by the Association of Business Drivers in Netherlands.

As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the fourth quarter. Over to you, Steven.
Steven Feng: Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenues in the fourth quarter were RMB 16.1 billion, representing an increase of 62.2% year-over-year, and 23.5% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 14.8 billion, representing an increase of 16.2% year-over-year and 23.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher deliveries, as a result of a more diversified product mix offered to our users.
The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to volume ramp up of the ET5 and ES7. Other sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 1.3 billion, representing an increase of 90.3% year-over-year, an increase of 22% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the increase of revenue from rendering of research and development services and increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales. The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to increase of revenue from rendering of research and development services and increasing sales for accessories charging piles and used cars in line with the incremental vehicle sales, partially offset by the sales of automotive regulatory credits in the third quarter of 2022.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.9%, compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 13.3% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to decreased vehicle margin. The decrease of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to decreased vehicle margin and the decrease in other sales margin, mainly resulted from the sales of automotive regulatory credits with high gross margin in the third quarter of 2022. More specifically, vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was 6.8% compared with 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 16.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to: first, increased inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the existing generation of ES8, ES6, NC6 but are expected to have lower production levels and deliveries due to the transition to new models on the NIO technology platform 2.0, which in totality elected impacted vehicle margin by 6.7%; and second, increased battery cost per unit.
The decrease of vehicle margin from the third quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increased inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the existing generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 4.0 billion, representing an increase of 117.7% year-over-year and 35.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was attributed to the increase personnel costs in research and development functions as well the incremental design and dividend cost of new products and technologies. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 3.5 billion, representing an increase of 49.6% year-over-year and 30% quarter-over-quarter.
The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to: first, the increase in percent costs related to sales and general corporate functions; second, the increase in marketing and promotion activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe. Third, in credit expenses related to the company's sales and service network expansion. Last, operations in the fourth quarter was RMB 6.7 billion, representing increase of 175.5% year-over-year and 74% quarter-over-quarter. Operating costs net in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 315.7 million, representing an increase of RMB 262.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of RMB 811.3 million for other losses of RMB 495.6 million in the third quarter of 2022.
The increase of adding comps year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but mainly due to the gains from the revaluation of our overseas RMB-related assets as the result of appreciation of RMB against US dollars in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.8 billion, representing an increase of 169.9% year-over-year and 40.8% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.8 billion, representing an increase of 168.3% year-over-year and 41.2% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investment in long-term time deposits was RMB 45.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to proceed with our Q&A session.

Ford Tracks Van and Truck Data To Warn Customers On ...,06-Mar-23,Ford Motor Co's (NYSE: F) wants to exploit reams of data from its vans and  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-tracks-van-truck-data-151826096.html,"Ford Motor Co's (NYSE: F) wants to exploit reams of data from its vans and trucks to tap more customers in the European and U.S. commercial vehicle market.
Ford has a 9-meter-long (30 ft) screen at its U.K. headquarters in Dunton, east of London that displays the vast data it tracks.
The screen showed real-time data from 114,000 vans in Britain so far covered by Ford's FORDLiive monthly subscription service, Reuters reports.
Ford employees focused on 98.3% of the vans in service. Of those, roughly 8% needed repairs fairly soon or urgently but concentrated even more on the 1.7% of vehicles out of action.
Ford tracks 4,000 data points via modems to warn against brake pad wear and low oil or diesel additives, which are costly to fix if not taken care of in advance.
Ford connected all of its U.K. dealers to its system, so it could arrange repairs and have parts ready for vans before they arrived at a dealership.
Ford is also launching the FORDLiive service in mainland Europe and the U.S. The automaker has focused more on its profitable Ford Pro business in Europe than on lower-margin mass-market passenger cars.
Hans Schep, European head of Ford Pro, the company's commercial vehicle business, said it is already close to hitting long-term targets of increasing vehicle ""uptime"" by up to 60%. Ford estimates downtime costs 600 pounds ($724) daily per van.
The U.K. operations of DHL Express, part of the Deutsche Post DHL Group, has 270 electric Ford E Transit vans with firm orders for 120 more and is signing up for FORDLiive. Fleet director Richard Crook said that besides monitoring those vans' batteries, he wants to tap Ford's predictive maintenance capabilities.
Price Action: F shares traded higher by 0.08% at $13.09 premarket on the last check Monday.

Can Solid-State Batteries Replace Lithium-Ion Technology?,07-Mar-23,A few days ago Ford Motor Co. suspended production and halted shipments of  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solid-state-batteries-replace-lithium-210000800.html,"Via AG Metal Miner
Lithium-ion is having a bad day – or year. In fact, depending on the source, “years” might be more appropriate. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) has powered batteries for portable consumable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and other products for over two decades. But now, with Tesla cars and millions of other products using the technology, the potential hazards are much more apparent. So while the surging lithium price remains problematic, countries like the U.S. also see the batteries as a major fire risk.
Almost every day, there’s a report of an electric vehicle catching fire somewhere around the world. Given the company’s designation as a market leader, fires involving Teslas often make the front pages. For instance, in California, spontaneous battery combustion recently caused a car to catch fire. According to firefighters, the vehicle needed almost 6,000 gallons of water to put out.
A few days ago, Ford Motor Co. suspended production and halted shipments of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup. The move came after a battery caught fire during a test drive in Michigan. Ford continues to investigate the cause of the blaze. However, until they get to the bottom of things, F-150 Lightning production will remain offline.
Lithium Price Now Part of a Bigger Problem for Automakers
The car industry has long been aware of the problems concerning lithium-ion batteries. However, industry leaders mainly focused on high costs, limited cycle count, and aging-related issues. Now they need to add spontaneous combustion to that list.
It would not be far-fetched to say li-ion batteries are losing popularity due to these fires. However, in reality, it’s just “one more thing” automakers have to deal with. High costs remain the major issue, as lithium – also known as “white gold” – continues to enjoy sky-high prices due to surging EV sales. Indeed, Elon Musk personally raised concerns over rising lithium costs just a few months ago.
Costs aside, automakers have had to contend with the environmental impact of lithium-ion for years now. It seems the more they position their product as green, the faster people point out the potential problems of li-ion battery disposal. The fact that these batteries are now getting a reputation for overheating and causing fires is only the icing on the cake for EV critics.
Just a few days ago, the New York Fire Department sounded the alarm on the dangers of Li-ion batteries. This came after the city saw as many as 22 fires in the first two months of 2023. The department even posted a video of a fire started by an electric skateboard. Elsewhere, other fire departments are grappling with the same issue. Many do not even have standard procedures for putting out such fires. After all, most experts say li-ion battery fires are still too new for there to be a consensus on the fastest way to deal with them.
That Was the Ugly: Now the Good and Bad From China
As if that weren’t enough of a headache, new developments from China will cause even more worries for lithium buyers. The global lithium supply is about to experience a new disruption due to shutdowns in Yichun City. The city lies in China’s Jiangxi province, which accounts for around a 10th of the world’s lithium supply. Unfortunately, it currently faces sweeping closures due to an environmental investigation.
According to the Yicai newspaper, the Chinese government has ordered that lithium ore-processing operations in Yichun shut down amid a probe for alleged environmental violations. The investigation adds uncertainty to a lithium market where prices have just begun petering off. So those companies hoping for a price break may not want to celebrate just yet.
Adding to the issue is the fact that the battery industry in China is on the cusp of a price war. According to a news report in 36Kr, CATL was actively considering a battery price reduction plan for key car companies, though this did not include Tesla. CATL even proposed a price reduction requirement of about 10% to its raw material suppliers. The report stated that the plan would come into play in the 3rd quarter once all the agreements were in place.
CATL’s move targeted only important customers like Li Auto, NIO, Huawei, and Zeekr. It set the proposed price of lithium carbonate at 200,000 yuan ($29,053) per metric ton. However, the car companies that sign the agreement must agree to purchase about 80% of their battery volume from CATL. The current price per ton of battery-grade lithium carbonate is about 470,000 yuan. Therefore, this represents a huge opportunity for those companies that sign on.
New Research Could Improve Lithium Battery Potential
Amidst all the doom and gloom comes a slightly more optimistic development. U.S. researchers recently announced they had developed a lithium-air battery with a solid electrolyte. The researchers claimed they could potentially increase the battery’s energy density fourfold over today’s lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, during tests, the prototype achieved an impressive 1,000 charge and discharge cycles.
Leading the project were the Illinois Institute of Technology and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory. According to a release on the project’s findings, the new battery utilizes a solid electrolyte made of a ceramic polymer material, carrying “relatively inexpensive elements in nano-particle form.” Meanwhile, a lithium anode and a cathode with an air-permeable structure complete the cell structure. The researchers claim the battery is suitable for use in electric cars, trucks, and planes. The development should bring cheer to the Biden administration, which has a policy to strengthen domestic supplies of critical elements, including lithium.
Back in the 1970s, the U.S. was a leading lithium producer. Not long after, however, processing moved overseas. Fortunately, the U.S. still has the fourth largest global lithium reserves, although the country only mines and processes around 1% of global lithium. It’s hoped that the government’s policy on critical elements will soon add more domestic production capacity to fuel the clean energy transition.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/george-soros-just-did-electric-190034986.html,"Possibly no investing legend is more polarizing than financier George Soros. Anyone who donates millions of dollars to further political agendas around the world is going to be controversial.
But whatever you think of his politics, his incredible success as an investor is undeniable. The refugee from Nazi-occupied Hungary who worked as a nightclub waiter in London is now one of the greatest investors of all time, with a net worth of $8.6 billion — and that’s after giving tens of billions of dollars away over the years.
It makes sense to at least understand the cornerstone of his investing philosophy.

How to Bend Reality to Your Investing Will
According to Soros, almost everything about conventional theories of finance is wrong.
Forget the “efficient market hypothesis” stating that shares of companies are already fairly priced by all available information, making efforts to beat market returns a fool’s errand.
Instead, Soros has pioneered something called the theory of reflexivity. It states that economic fundamentals are malleable.
To oversimplify, reflexivity means that investors’ perceptions can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
This may seem obvious in the short term. For example, if investors think that gold is a good hedge against inflation, and they believe inflation is coming or already rampant, then gold prices will go up.
It doesn’t matter that, when you strip emotions and biases from your views on gold, it’s ultimately just a metal that “sits and looks at you,” as business magnate Warren Buffett put it.
But because of the power of reflexivity, gold has been an enormous force for wealth creation over the last few millennia. The same can be said of other assets with no intrinsic value like Bitcoin.
Soros Fund Management LLC has boosted Bitcoin before, with Chief Investment Officer Dawn Fitzpatrick announcing a stake in Bitcoin while declaring it had “crossed the chasm into the mainstream.” Bitcoin soared in the months ahead — and as the theory of reflexivity would predict, the validation from Soros didn’t hurt.

Soros Is Boosting Another Industry
In August, Soros made another massive foray into electric vehicle (EV) stocks. According to second-quarter filings, he purchased $20 million worth of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares, while buying shares of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) for the first time.
Soros bought over $27 million of Ford in total, just before the company began delivering orders for its new electric F-150 pickup trucks. He also increased his fund's positions in EV companies Nio Inc. (NYSE: NIO) and Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID).
This diversification across multiple EV companies amounts to a broad bet on the sector as a whole. And as the Biden Administration establishes America’s first-ever national network of EV charging stations, this catch-all bet may pay off handsomely for Soros and any investors who emulate it.

Tesla (TSLA) Investor Day: Cruxes From Master Plan Part 3,07-Mar-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-investor-day-cruxes-151003834.html,"Tesla TSLA, on its first ever Investor Day, revealed the third part of its Master Plan, which focuses on making a complete shift toward a greener future. CEO Elon Musk sets forth his intent on powering the existing gridlines with renewable energy and producing up to 20 million cars per year over the course of the next few years.

For domestic heating, Tesla plans to use heat pumps, which consume one-third of the total energy consumed by fossil fuels and use green hydrogen as a substitute of coal to fuel furnaces used in steel production. The EV pioneer eventually wants to fuel planes and boats through electrification using structural batteries.

The entire project will require a total of $10 trillion in investment, which according to Musk is “not a big number relative to global economy.” Musk said, “There is a clear path to a sustainable energy on Earth. It doesn’t require destroying natural habitats. It doesn’t require us to be austere and stop using electricity and sort of be in the cold or anything.”

The world’s total storage capacity needs to get expanded by 240 TWh to achieve a fully sustainable earth. The plan will require 30% of Earth’s nickel, less than 0.2% of Earth’s surface for infrastructure needed to execute the plan and possibly a massive amount of iron, which is available in abundance.

Elon Musk also discussed their new gigafactory that will be built in Monterrey, Mexico and help the company reach its target of manufacturing 20 million vehicles per year. Further, Tesla has devised a more efficient way, called the “Unboxed Process,” to manufacture its next-generation vehicles.

While Tesla successfully checked almost all the boxes included in its first master plan, it missed a lot of them in its second. With the Part Deux plan posed in 2016, the company’s vision of creating a thriving solar business suffered a massive blow due to an unreasonably high price. Tesla displayed a production prototype of the Cybertruck (also a part of Part Deux plan), for which deliveries are planned to start this year.

Tesla’s Cybertruck is set to face tough competition from Ford’s F F-150 Lightning and General Motors’ GM GMC Hummer e-truck.

Ford’s F-series has been the best-selling truck in the United States for more than four decades and its electric version, the F-150 Lightning Pro, is carrying forward the success, pivoting Ford for a notable transition in the electric space. The all-electric F-150 e-pickup hit the market in spring 2022.

The first deliveries of General Motors’ Hummer EV pickup began in December 2021 and it was the first model to include next-generation battery cells and a platform known as Ultium. General Motors is working on two other pickup models — Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra e-trucks.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) share price has soared 162% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. Then again, the 9.7% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders. We note that the broader market is down 6.6% in the last month, and this may have impacted Ford Motor's share price.
While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, Ford Motor achieved compound earnings per share growth of 73% per year. However, extraordinary items have impacted recent EPS numbers. This EPS growth is higher than the 38% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Ford Motor the TSR over the last 3 years was 189%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
A Different Perspective
We regret to report that Ford Motor shareholders are down 23% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 12%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Ford Motor that you should be aware of before investing here.

The market volatility that started in 2022 also took its toll on the automobile industry. The industry, which was in the spotlight for several years amid the EV boom, is expected to struggle as innovative EV companies that were hoping to follow an easy path to profitability are now facing new challenges amid inflation and slowing demand. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas voiced similar concerns earlier this year. Jonas thinks 2023 would be a ""hunker down"" year for the sector. Jonas said in his note to investors that he continues to expect auto companies investing in electrification, but the pace of these investments will slow down as “the cyclical downturn forces incremental capital discipline.""
In October 2022, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak  warned that 2023 estimates for car companies would be lower.
Another warning came from UBS Group AG analysts led by Patrick Hummel, who said that profits for US and European car companies were expected to drop by a whopping 50% in 2023 amid weakening demand.  UBS analysts at that time decreased their ratings for major car stocks like Volkswagen AG, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Renault SA and Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F).
Recently, it was reported that major car companies in China, including Ford, BMW, Volkswagen and General Motors, have started offering discounts on their car prices amid declining sales. Car sales in China fell in January and February as consumers cut back on spending amid an uncertain economic situation. Analysts were expecting these sales declines to reverse after the country reopened its economy, but that optimism fell flat.
But amidst this turmoil, a silver lining for the car industry is that the supply-chain issues and semiconductor shortages that hammered the sector for a couple of years are finally beginning to resolve. The net effect of this development would be that car sales in the US are expected to remain better-than-expected, despite inflation and macroeconomic headwinds. The US auto industry is expected to grow by about 1 million vehicles in 2023 to about 15 million units, according to Bloomberg.
Another key growth driver for car stocks remains the EV boom, which continues to change the industry dynamics, to such an extent that data now suggests internal combustion engine vehicle sales might never recover to their pre-pandemic level of popularity. Bloomberg said in a report that its analysis shows that internal combustion vehicle sales peaked in 2017, at 86 million vehicles. During that year battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models accounted for a total of one million vehicles sold. Come 2022, the situation completely changed, with conventional engine vehicle sales coming in at 69 million during the year, while plug-in vehicle sales jumped to 10.4 million.
In this situation, almost all major car companies that used to produce conventional cars are heavily investing in electrification. As the car industry goes through a major transition, it's interesting to see which car stocks are on famous analysts' radar.

To skip our detailed analysis of the electric vehicle sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap EV Stocks To Buy.
The electric vehicle (EV) sector and the related battery manufacturing industry have been dominated by China for years. We have reported before that China produced about 75% of all electric vehicle battery cells as of 2023. In 2022, a Chinese EV manufacturer BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) overtook Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's largest EV maker with 1.87 million deliveries of EVs in that year, compared to the latter's 1.3 million deliveries. This development alone is enough to bear witness to the fact that China is continuing to retain its monopoly over the EV sector while the US continues to fight its dominance. Companies like Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) have joined Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in this fight. At Cowen's 15th Annual Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference, Fisker Inc.'s (NYSE:FSR) Chairman and CEO, Henrik Fisker, mentioned that he foresaw the company expanding to be able to produce a million electric vehicles in a year in 2027. As such, the company is among the fastest growing EV companies in the US today.
The US has been attempting to counter the Chinese dominance over the EV sector for almost three years now. In 2021, President Biden first signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure and Investment and Jobs Act. This move signified increased funding for EV charging stations through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Discretionary Grant Program for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure. These programs contributed about $5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, to the US government's plans to uplift its local EV and EV charging companies. Later,  in 2022, the Biden-Harris administration also awarded a $2.8 billion grant to 20 companies. This grant also draws on the funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and is meant to support the creation of battery-grade materials such as lithium, graphite, and nickel.
Such consistent efforts to support the American EV sector may be why a number of traditional automotive companies such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have been foraging into the EV space. According to a Reuters article published in October, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) continued to increase its spending on new EVs throughout 2022 and had spent about $50 billion by October. The company aims to produce about 3 million battery electric models (BEVs) in 2030, an ambitious goal that shows the car maker's dedication to the EV sector.
In general, the world's top automakers are planning to spend about $1.2 trillion through 2030 on the development and production of millions of EVs and their batteries and raw materials. As a result, the EV sector continues to expand, making investments in this space a relatively attractive opportunity for investors today. In many ways, several EV stocks are considered cheap investment options since analysts consider many of these stocks to be deeply undervalued. As such, we have compiled a list of the cheapest EV stocks below. Stellar companies like Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), among more, were excluded from the list for the sole reason that their valuation, based on their enterprise-value to revenue metric, could not be considered 'cheap' for the purposes of this article.

Stripe nearly halves valuation to $50 billion following $6.5 ...,15-Mar-23,Stripe which counts Amazon.com Inc Ford Motor Co Salesforce and BMW  among ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fintech-stripe-valued-50-billion-210919718.html,"By Milana Vinn and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Payments processor Stripe on Wednesday raised $6.5 billion in a funding round led by existing and new investors at a sharply reduced valuation of $50 billion, down nearly 50% from two years ago.
Stripe said it would use the cash to cover a large tax bill associated with stock granted to employees and to provide liquidity to employees.
About $3.5 billion of the newly-raised capital will be used to cover the tax bill, with the rest being used to buy shares from employees, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity as these discussions were confidential.
The latest funding marks a steep decline in the valuation of the fintech startup, which was valued at $95 billion in March 2021.
Stripe said it did not need the new funds to run its business. Venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Baillie Gifford, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, MSD Partners, and Thrive Capital led the latest funding round, according to a statement from the company.
While Stripe still plans to eventually proceed with an initial public offering, that is unlikely this year, the person said.
Stripe had initially targeted a fundraising of about $4 billion, but ended up garnering more demand from investors than it initially anticipated, the person added.
New investors such as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Goldman Sachs Asset and Wealth Management and Temasek also participated in the round, Stripe said.
After years of signing big checks for high-flying startups, investors have turned more cautious as the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening drains out excess liquidity.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-boost-car-infotainment-170005608.html,"Alphabet’s GOOGL Google continues to gain momentum in the car infotainment space and solid traction among the automakers on the back of its robust technology and user-friendly apps.

This is evident from the latest discussions between Google and Porsche. Reportedly, the latter is in talks to integrate the former’s software into the car cockpit.

Notably, the deal would boost the adoption rate of Google Automotive Services.

Further, it would give Porsche’s customers access to Google apps like Google Maps and Google Assistant. Car owners won’t be required to connect their vehicles to their Android phones at all.

Hence, the user base of these apps is expected to expand if the underlined deal strikes.

 Other Noteworthy Deals
Apart from the latest talks with Porsche, Google has won remarkable deals from well-recognized car makers.

General Motors and Ford F have already incorporated Google software into their vehicles’ infotainment systems through Google Automotive Services. Moreover, Ford is set to roll out several cars with infotainment systems powered by Android this year.

Further, Volvo has integrated Google infotainment systems into its vehicles. Its cross-country models like XC60, S90, V90 and V90 feature built-in Android-powered infotainment systems.
Growth Prospects
Per the latest report from Polaris Market Research, the in-vehicle infotainment market is expected to register a CAGR of 10.9% between 2022 and 2030.

According to a report from Straits Research, the market is anticipated to hit $50.64 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 10.3% between 2023 and 2031.

Further, a Grand View Research report indicates that the global automotive infotainment system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.7% between 2023 and 2030.

Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, this market is likely to reach $36.6 billion by 2028 with a CAGR of 6.8% between 2023 and 2028.

Google’s winning deals with auto makers, along with its user-friendly Android operating system and robust vehicle infotainment software, position it well to capitalize on the abovementioned growth prospects.
Moreover, its expanding footprint in this promising market is expected to aid its parent company, Alphabet, in winning investors’ confidence in the near term.

Notably, GOOGL has lost 27.6% over a year against the industry’s loss of 26.9%.

Further, Google’s growing momentum among the auto makers is expected to boost its competitive edge against Apple AAPL, which is also leaving no stone unturned to bolster its presence in this booming market.

Notably, Apple is gaining momentum on the back of its advanced software for vehicles, known as CarPlay, which has evolved from an infotainment system to an all-round in-car software solution.

Recently, Volvo incorporated CarPlay into its new Android powered vehicles. This remains a positive.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.
The China Factor Affecting the EV Industry
The EV industry and its related segments almost always remain in the news amid the explosive growth potential and huge demand of electric cars in the world. However, lithium companies, which have a key role to play in the EV revolution, are in the news for a negative reason as their stock prices are falling after Chinese battery company CATL reportedly offered some discounts to EV makers. This comes as lithium prices struggle to post a comeback amid a supply glut. Some notable stocks taking it on the chin because of this news from China include Albemarle, Lithium Americas, Livent and SQM.
Some analysts also believe that pricing wars and oversupply in the market could spillover and affect major pure-play EV companies too, including Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc - ADR (NYSE:XPEV). Oversupply in China would translate to lower margins for these companies.
Despite all these headwinds, it’s almost a consensus among analysts that in a couple of decades electric vehicles will be widely popular among the masses. EV companies are already racing to build low-cost versions of electric cars to make them more accessible to the customer. Latest data from BloombergNEF shows that annual spending on passenger EVs touched a whopping $388 billion in 2022, up 53% from the year before.
Explosive Growth
If you look at this figure from a different angle, you can see the huge potential the EV industry has. The Bloomberg report said that global auto sales are worth about $2.5 trillion per year.  EVs first popped up on the automotive industry radar about a decade ago. During this period, total car sales in the world had a worth of about $25 trillion. However, the total value of electric vehicles sold to date as of 2022 in the passenger vehicle segment is $1 trillion. In this context, the EV industry still looks in its early stages. Bloomberg’s data suggest that 60% of the total EV spending occurred in the last 18 months. This scale of growth will definitely take over the legacy car industry in the coming years.
The Customer Wins
Consumers are getting an abundance of choices when it comes to EVs. You no longer have to choose from just the two or three big names in the market (Leaf, Bolt, Tesla). Some new entrants in the market making waves among the masses include Nissan Ariya, Audi Q4 e-tron, Cadillac Lyriq, Mercedes EQB SUV, among others. Car companies are offering new designs, technologies, interior/exterior features and much more, pointing to the intense competition that is ultimately benefitting the consumer.

In January 2023, Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) shares soared after BofA analyst Steven Byrne upgraded the stock to Buy from Underperform. The analyst said that the outlook for the lithium sector is “constructive” over the medium- to long-term. However, he noted that volatility in demand has driven price softness in the industry.
“We see current shares as pricing in too low of a lithium market price over the cycle, and thus rate shares Buy accordingly,” Byrne said.
However, the analyst slashed his price target on Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) to $26.
At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) shares. The total worth of these stakes was over $250 million.
Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:
“Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is a pure-play, fully integrated producer of performance lithium compounds. The stock underperformed amid investor concerns about how a potential decelerating rate of growth in overall electric vehicle (EV) production and demand, primarily in China, would affect the future price of lithium. Despite these potential near-term headwinds, longer-term the global lithium market remains tight, and we believe Livent plays a critical role in the battery value chain and remains well- positioned for the overall continued global adoption of EVs.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has pledged to become a leader in the EV revolution in America. Back in 2021 Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced huge investments in the EV sector as it revealed plans to develop a complex dedicated to EV projects.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”

- Pras, we're also watching shares of Ford right now that were down more than 4.5%. This is after the company announced a recall. So tell us about that.
PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, we wrote about this a couple weeks ago about how Ford is suffering from recalls. They have the most cars recalled since 2022 of any manufacturer. So in this case, 1.3 million cars recalled for a brake line failure for Lincoln MKX and Ford Fusion. This is a big safety issue, right, because it's basically stopping becomes much harder without brake fluid.
So big problem here in that Ford says only 2% of cars have this issue potentially. One crash so far. But so that's 26,000 vehicles that will potentially go and have a problem. So they're going to fix that. Also separately they had a 220,000 F-150 with a lesser issue, a windshield wiper motor problem. Not the end of the world there, but still a safety issue nonetheless.
- Pras Subramanian, thanks so much and have a good weekend.","{'negative': 0.7697083294391632, 'neutral': 0.8518130083878835, 'positive': 0.702944278717041}",0.8518130083878835,0.702944278717041,0.7697083294391632

After the dust seemingly having settled on the job cuts that kicked off the year, on March 14th, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) revealed it will be laying off 10,000 more workers after already having laid off 11,000 workers back in November which together makes a workforce reduction of 25% from the company’s peak only half a year ago.CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously told analysts that the company is cutting on projects that are not rising to expectations or are no longer crucial to its vision while reducing middle management workforce to be able to speed up its decision making in what he pinned will be a year of efficiency.
Restructuring Efforts Allow A Quiet Shut Down Of Ventures That Haven’t Justified Expectations
The truth of the matter is that broad restructuring will allow Zuckerberg to quietly abandon his misguided efforts to sell virtual reality headsets to employers. Still, the company continues to spend billions of dollars to make the meta universe a reality through virtual reality and augmented reality technologies as the in-charge Reality Labs division lost about $13.7 billion last year on $2.16 billion of revenue.
It Seems Musk Was The One Who Started The Trend
Besides its EV mark, it seems Elon Musk was also one of the first to have started the tech layoffs wave when he slaughtered Twitter’s staff last year when he acquired the social media platform by reducing the workforce of 7,500 employees to about 2,000, with reportedly an additional 10% of employees cuts last month. The fact that he succeeded to keep the platform somewhat running, Musk has somehow been able to keep the social media platform running has surely inspired other CEOs to revaluate their ability to do more with less which in this case would be a skeletonized workforce.
Apple Seemingly Closer To Boarding The Layoffs Train
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was a rare player to avoid the wave of big layoffs but it also did not participate in the pandemic-fueled hiring binge. However, it ended up joining the cost cut bandwagon on March 15th as it revealed it will be easing on bonuses and hiring, triggering fears of layoffs are on the horizon. Therefore, an argument can be made that Apple has been able to avoid layoffs mostly because it was more measured in its hiring and spending during the pandemic, with even CEO Tim Cook taking a pay cut himself.
A Herd Mentality
It’s no secret that Silicon Valley enterprises hire together as a pack, and they fire together as one as well. In January, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced a new round of layoffs across several divisions, impacting 18,000 employees. Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL), Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) also joined with significant workforce reductions with Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google laying off 12,000 workers, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10,000 employees and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM) making a cut of 7,000 jobs. A former PayPal Holdings Inc executive (NASDAQ: PYPL) Keith Rabois was not the only one to criticize these companies for being overstaffed and unproductive.
The Silicon Valley Is Taking A Page From The Automotive Industry's Book
Unlike the automotive industry where electrification is simply making some jobs go extinct, tech executives are blaming over-hiring and fake work such as attending meetings for their need to thin the ranks. But then a question is raised is this the effect of a downturn or simply that a time has come to work smarter and get leaner. This scenario undoubtedly reflects the one the automotive industry and the global restructuring that General Motors (NYSE: GM) underwent in 2019 when it cut tens of thousands of jobs and closed factories across states. On the other hand, GM, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) are now in great need for employees with software skills as unlike internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs are more about software than hardware.
Layoffs Reveal A Deeper Truth
The intense tech hiring boom trend has now transformed to a trend of mass layoffs. Although on the surface, this is about cost control, this is also a signal of a deeper shift as until now, Big Tech used to make its own rules, but now it needs to revaluate its success metrics to keep Wall Street happy. One clear example is Salesforce whose CEO Marc Benioff was able to defy calls to grow the company’s profitability alongside revenue for years but activist investors have forced him to focus more on profit margins and reduce the company’s workforce as a consequence.
The Effect Of An Economic Downturn
For now, it seems junior positions are still in demand while middle management is the one takin ga hit. But thiscooler hiring market has also given way to salary normalization as CIO dive reported that data suggests tech worker pay is still growing, but more modestly compared to recent years. The long-term effects on the IT talent are still to be seen but it is clear that tech firms are resorting to more traditional metrics of success, showing that at the end of the day, it’s all about making Wall Street happy.

Ford CFO: We are 'refounding' the company cutting costs to ...,23-Mar-23,Yahoo. Advertisement. Yahoo Finance. Ford CFO: We are 'refounding ... Ford  Motor Company' unveils their new electric F-150 Lightning outside of...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cfo-we-are-refounding-the-company-cutting-costs-to-make-ev-business-profitable-142129598.html,"Standing up an EV business to rival category heavyweight Tesla (TSLA) is coming at a hefty price for storied automaker Ford (F), one it's prepared to address with aggressive cost cuts.
Ford revealed Thursday it lost $2.1 billion on an operating basis in its Model E (electric) division last year. The automaker guided to an operating loss of $3 billion for the division for 2023 as it invests in production and battery capacity. The business is expected to reach profitability in 2026.
""Our cost structure is not competitive,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We know that we [have] about $7 billion to $8 billion that we could take out and improve our competitiveness, and you will see that start to take hold as we get through the rest of the year, into 2024, and beyond.""
""This is about 'refounding' Ford,"" Lawler said about the company's cost cuts and operating structure.

As Lawler pointed out, Ford could take out $7 billion in costs from its legacy auto business to help fuel its EV ambitions and bolster overall profit margins.
Ford provided the information as part of a ""teach-in"" for analysts at the New York Stock Exchange as it pivots to an electrified future.
The event is aimed to help Wall Street better understand the inner workings of Ford by breaking out the business into three new segments: Model E, Ford Blue (gas-powered vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial vehicles and other services).
Ford further reaffirmed its full-year adjusted operating profit guidance of $9 billion to $11 billion. Lawler said the outlook factors in recent economic turmoil spurred by the rolling banking crisis.
Ford stock rose 1.8% in early trading on Thursday.

Is Ford Motor (NYSE:F) A Risky Investment?,20-Mar-23,' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt when you think  about how risky any given stock is because too much debt can sink a  company. As with...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-nyse-f-risky-110042306.html,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Ford Motor Company ( NYSE:F ) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What Is Ford Motor's Net Debt?
The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Ford Motor had US$138.4b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. However, it also had US$32.2b in cash, and so its net debt is US$106.2b.
debt-equity-history-analysis
How Healthy Is Ford Motor's Balance Sheet?
Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Ford Motor had liabilities of US$96.9b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$115.9b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$32.2b as well as receivables valued at US$4.58b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$176.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$45.0b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. After all, Ford Motor would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.
It is worth noting that a significant portion of Ford's debt is linked to Ford Credit, which provides financing services to customers. However, this does not eliminate the risk for the company. If customers default on their payments, Ford could still face financial risks. Hence, investors should consider the level of risk associated with Ford's overall debt position, including the debt associated with Ford Credit.
We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.
As it happens Ford Motor has a fairly concerning net debt to EBITDA ratio of 7.5 but very strong interest coverage of 11.9. So either it has access to very cheap long term debt or that interest expense is going to grow! Shareholders should be aware that Ford Motor's EBIT was down 27% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Ford Motor can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last two years, Ford Motor produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 53% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.
Our View
On the face of it, Ford Motor's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. Overall, it seems to us that Ford Motor's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Ford Motor .
If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.

Ford (F) to Recall 1.5M Vehicles Over Brake and Wiper Issues,20-Mar-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Wabash National ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-recall-1-5m-155303525.html,"According to a NHTSA document, Ford F is recalling around 1.3 million vehicles across the United States to address leaky brake hoses that increase the possibility of a crash. Ford Fusions and Lincoln MKZs sedans with model years 2013-2018 are part of the recall. Moreover, the automaker is also recalling nearly 220,000 F-150 pickups to fix defective windshield wiper arms.

NHTSA says the fluid-carrying rubber hoses could rupture prematurely, causing the fluid to leak. In the given case, the driver may experience an increase in pedal travel and a reduction in the rate of deceleration, increasing the possibility of a crash.

According to Ford’s estimates, out of all the vehicles that are part of the faulty brake hose recall, only 2% are detected with the defect. So far, Ford has registered only one case of a crash related to the issue with no mention of injuries.

Warning signs include ‘a change in the feel and travel of the brake pedal’ and the brake fluid indicator turning on. The auto manufacturer plans to notify the concerned owners via mail between Apr 17 and 28. The concerned owners must take their cars to a Lincoln or Ford dealership to get the faulty hoses replaced free of charge. NHTSA claims that the new hoses are made of a different material braid and are more robust.

Concurrently, Ford is also recalling its F-150 pickup trucks, launched in 2021, to inspect and, if necessary, replace faulty windshield wiper arms. A defective spline could result in failure of the windshield wiper motors, because of which the wipers could stop working during adverse weather conditions or even break off. Before failing, one or both wipers start moving slowly or erratically.

Ford has observed 576 cases of inoperative or detached windshield wiper arms and 9 complaints to NHTSA, but no crashes have resulted in any injuries.

The manufacturer plans to inform the concerned truck owners via mail starting Mar 31. Owners can take their trucks to authorized dealers to have their wiper arms inspected. If necessary, the arms would be replaced free of cost. In case, the owner has already paid to replace the arms, the amount will be reimbursed.

Last November, Ford recalled nearly 450,000 F-150 Lightning trucks to fix a windshield wiper issue.

Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-built-ford-proud-campaign-123000976.html,"DEARBORN, Mich., March 22, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--An actor restoring a Bronco. A professional stunt driver defying stereotypes. A big wave surfer with a passion for trucks. These are drivers that will be featured the next chapter of Ford Motor Company’s ""Built Ford Proud"" campaign, showcasing how Sydney Sweeney, Dee Bryant, and Kai Lenny use their vehicles to achieve their dreams.
""Built Ford Proud"" features content starring Sweeney, Bryant, and Lenny and celebrates the greater community of Ford drivers who have broken the mold, driven innovation, and defied stereotypes for nearly 120 years.

Sydney Sweeney is an Emmy Award-nominated actor from Euphoria and The White Lotus. Known as the ""only girl in the shop,"" she chronicles her love for restoring her vintage Ford Bronco on her TikTok channel @Syd’s_Garage. This passion has led her to team with Ford in hopes of inspiring women to feel more comfortable working on their vehicles – traditionally a hobby associated with men. Sweeney’s Auto 101 tutorials teach viewers how to check their vehicle tire pressure, jump a dead battery and other aspects of vehicle maintenance.
Ford and Sweeney will also launch an exclusive workwear collection, Ford x Sydney Sweeney. The collection, made in partnership with Dickies, is available at merchandise.ford.com.
""This campaign is very genuine to me,"" Sweeney said. ""Through my Auto 101 series and the female-forward workwear collection, I hope to empower and uplift women to pursue their passions, to get involved in the world of cars, and show that anyone can follow their dreams, no matter what they are!""
Dee Bryant is one of the few female African American professional stunt drivers in the entertainment industry and the co-founder of the Association of Women Drivers. Bryant is determined to rally others against racism and sexism and pave the way for the next generation of female stunt drivers.
As part of the campaign, Bryant will give viewers a closer look at the Mustang Mach-E and unleash her skills in a three-part social series, ""Stuff Only Dee Should Do"" featuring the all-new 2024 Ford Mustang.
Kai Lenny is a Big Wave surfer whose mental toughness and physical strength can only be matched by Ford trucks. Lenny pays it forward by inspiring the next generation of athletes in his community.
As part of this campaign, Lenny will show a day in the life of a world champion as he and his family use their fleet of Ford trucks to transport his team, jet skis, and retired coast guard boat to locations around Maui, Hawaii.
Ford has also donated eight surfboards – with colors matching the all-new 2023 Ford F- Series Super Duty – to Lenny’s charity, the Positively Kai Foundation, which provides young surfers equal opportunities to pursue their passion.

According to a market research study published by Contrive Datum Insights, The North American market is one of the largest in the world, with a high demand for SUVs and pickup trucks.
Farmington, March 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Automotive Market Is Expected To Grow From USD 23 Billion In 2022 To USD 28.7 Billion By 2030, at a CAGR Of 4.5%. The global automotive market is a large and diverse industry that includes making, selling, and distributing cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The market is marked by fierce competition among the top players, quickly changing consumer tastes, and more rules and regulations from the government.
The market is expected to keep growing in the coming years because of a number of factors, such as the rising demand for personal and commercial vehicles, the rise of new technologies like electric and self-driving cars, and the growing awareness of safety and environmental issues among consumers.
The market can be broken up by the type of vehicle, how it moves, and where it is. Passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles, and two-wheelers are the main types of vehicles on the market. Internal combustion engines, electric vehicles, and hybrid vehicles are the main types of vehicles' engines.
Several big companies, such as Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai, control most of the market. To gain market share and make more money, these players are competing on many fronts, such as new products, pricing, and distribution strategies.

Segmentation Overview:
Vehicle Type Insights:
Vehicles that use gasoline or diesel engines are called Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Even though ICE cars have been the most popular for a long time, their market share is slowly going down because of worries about pollution and climate change.
Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) use a fuel cell to turn hydrogen into electricity, which powers an electric motor. FCEVs are still not very common, but their long range and lack of pollution make them look like a good technology for the future.
Function Insights:
Airbags, seatbelts, anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic stability control, and advanced driver assistance systems are all safety features (ADAS). Consumers care more and more about safety features, and many places have laws that require them.
Comfort and Convenience features include automatic climate control, power windows, heated seats, infotainment systems, navigation, and adaptive cruise control. People often think that these features are necessary for a modern car, and consumers are coming to expect them more and more.
Style and Design refers to how a car looks, including its exterior and interior design, colour choices, and the materials it is made of. Style and design are often important to people who want a car that matches their own taste and style.
Regional Outlook:
The United States, Canada, and Mexico are all in North America. The North American market is one of the biggest in the world, and SUVs and pickup trucks are in high demand there. American automakers make up most of the market, but many foreign automakers also have a big presence.
Middle East and Africa is made up of places like Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. The Middle East and Africa market is known for its high demand for SUVs, pickup trucks, and luxury vehicles. European and American automakers make up most of the market, but many Asian automakers also have a big presence.
The Asia-Pacific region is the world's biggest and fastest-growing market, and there is a lot of demand for small, cheap cars there. North America and Europe are mature markets where SUVs, pickup trucks, and luxury cars are in high demand. Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are all new markets where SUVs and pickup trucks that are affordable are in high demand. Regional differences in consumer tastes, rules, and infrastructure can also have a big effect on each region's auto market.

Market Dynamics:
Driving Factors:
Increasing demand for passenger and commercial vehicles: The global demand for cars, especially passenger cars, keeps going up because of things like more people living in cities, more money in their pockets, and better roads.
Adoption of advanced technologies: The automotive market is growing because more people are buying electric cars and cars that drive themselves. Electric vehicles are becoming more popular because people are worried about the environment and the government offers incentives and subsidies. Autonomous vehicles, on the other hand, are expected to make roads safer and reduce traffic congestion.
Increasing government regulations and standards: Governments all over the world are putting in place stricter rules and regulations about emissions, fuel efficiency, and safety. This is driving innovation and leading to the development of new and more advanced automotive technologies.
Shift towards shared mobility: Shared mobility services like ride-hailing and car-sharing are becoming more popular. This is likely to increase the demand for cars, especially in cities, and help the automotive market grow.
Restraining Factors:
Economic volatility: Uncertainty in the economy, especially in emerging markets, can affect the demand for cars and cause sales and profits to go up and down.
Supply chain disruptions: Disruptions to the global supply chain, like those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause production delays, shortages of inventory, and higher prices.
Opportunity Factors:
Electric and hybrid vehicles: Manufacturers have a big chance to make a lot of money from the growing demand for electric and hybrid cars. With more people caring about the environment and more government rules requiring sustainable transportation, companies that invest in making advanced electric and hybrid cars are likely to see strong demand in the coming years.
Connected cars: The growing demand for connected cars, which use digital technologies like GPS, entertainment systems, and driver assistance systems, gives manufacturers a big chance to make money. As more people want cars with high-tech features and better connectivity, companies that put money into developing connected car technologies are likely to see a lot of demand.
Shift towards shared mobility: The growth of shared mobility services like ride-hailing and car-sharing gives manufacturers a big chance to make money. As these services continue to grow in popularity, it's likely that there will be more demand for cars that are made specifically for sharing.
Digital transformation: More and more digital technologies, like artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things, are being used in the automotive industry. This is a huge opportunity for manufacturers. As the industry keeps changing, manufacturers who use these technologies to improve their production processes make the customer experience better, and cut costs are likely to become more competitive and make more money.

You don't stop paying for your car when you leave the dealership. In fact, every car that isn't fully electric requires a sizable donation every time the gas light comes on. The cost of filling up at the pump is one of the key factors in determining any vehicle's long-term ownership costs, and seemingly small differences in fuel economy can add big bucks to the cost of owning a vehicle over the years.
Cars get better gas mileage than trucks and many SUVs, but not all cars, trucks and SUVs are created equal. When it comes to vehicles, every class and category has standout models that give drivers more bang for their buck at the pump.

GOBankingRates has compiled a list of the 2023 model year cars that offer the best fuel economy. All mpg estimates are for the most efficient options and all vehicles are ranked in order of fuel efficiency in their category, from most efficient to least.
Read on to learn which vehicles offer the best fuel economy in their class. Great fuel economy can make a car less expensive over time -- no matter how pricey that vehicle might be.

Types Of Vehicles
When it comes to fuel economy, a smaller passenger vehicle will mostly give you more gas mileage than a larger one meant to do more than just commute. However, fuel efficiency varies significantly across the four types of vehicles GOBankingRates looked at: cars, trucks, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and hybrids that applied to the previous three classifications.
Find out which of these 2023 vehicles will take you the farthest without a fill-up.

SUVs
Sport utility vehicles are a loosely defined class of passenger vehicles that offer the comfort and road performance of regular cars blended with elements usually associated with off-road vehicles. Those elements often include things like all-wheel drive, higher ground clearance and advanced suspensions. GOBankingRates profiled SUVs that included hybrid and non-hybrid options, as well as sizes.
There's no official size that determines which SUVs are ""small,"" but they're more compact, get better gas mileage and are easier to park than midsize SUVs. The downside is they can hold fewer people and less stuff. Larger SUVS can often be called full-size SUVs, which are the biggest sport utility vehicles on the road. They're big, they're hard to park and they're not great on gas, but they're powerful, roomy and tend to have higher-end tech offerings.

Trucks
Pickup trucks are light trucks characterized by enclosed cabs in the front and open cargo beds in the back. They gobble gas more quickly than cars, but they're robust, functional and capable both on and off the road.
Midsize trucks are the smallest pickups you can buy. They're more affordable than their full-size cousins, but they offer reduced towing capacity, smaller beds and cabs and lower payload capacity. Full-size trucks, on the other hand, are big, powerful pickups with heavy payload capacities and towing capacities that regularly break into five digits. They can often accommodate six adult passengers.

Hybrids

The electric motor saves gas, and when it runs low on energy, the engine kicks and takes over while also charging the battery.

Is It A Big Deal?
A lot can be said for Ford’s honesty with the public, its investors and potential EV buyers. Rather than hide from or sugarcoat the truth, the automobile giant has been straightforward about its investment in electric vehicles and the impact on its bottom line.
Losing $3 billion — even for a company Ford’s size — is always a big deal. But Ford and its investors can take solace in the fact that the company still expects to generate a profit of between $9 billion and $11 billion this year.
It’s much easier to lose $3 billion in the EV niche when the company as a whole is making up for it with more than three times the profits. The company also has its sights set on an 8% profit margin for the division by the end of 2026.

Why Is Ford Struggling In The EV Space?
Earlier this year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said during an earnings call that the company underestimated the expenses associated with boosting the production of electric vehicles.
“We didn’t know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn’t know it’s 70 pounds heavier and that that’s [an extra] $300 a battery,” he said. “We didn’t know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size.”
These sound like oversights, but they’re actually growing pains. The electric vehicle market is still in its infancy. Automakers are constantly tweaking processes. Consumers are comparing their options and deciding whether it makes sense to buy now or wait until more of the kinks are worked out.
Other Problems The EV Market Must Solve
In addition to the above, other serious problems are standing in the way of the mass adoption of electric vehicles:
Inadequate charging infrastructure: It’s improving throughout the country but is far from where it needs to be to handle an ever-growing number of electric vehicles.
EV fueling costs: All-encompassing, the cost of fueling an electric vehicle is often higher than a gasoline-powered vehicle. This is a deterrent to consumers who are on the fence.
EV prices remain high: Until prices are on par with their gasoline-powered counterparts, electric vehicles will be considered a luxury purchase by most.
As leading automakers like Ford, General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. continue to spend big money — and take big losses — on electric vehicles, several startups are making noise at the bottom of the market.

High-Risk, High Reward
It’s clear that there’s some serious upside associated with the risks involved. From general goodwill associated with their brands to the billions to be made in the current and future EV models. Lucid Group Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. are still sitting at premiums compared the ICE market, with many still bullish on the companies. Hence why these legacy automakers are willing to take these risks and invest in these technologies.
One of the biggest indicators, however, comes from the people investing in and, more importantly, buying these cars. Tesla Inc. began its climb to its astronomical heights when retail investors flocked to short-squeeze the stock, ultimately giving Tesla the billions it needed to thrive. Retail investors have been pouring millions into these clean-tech startups and other stocks and companies. So brands able to capture that value will reap the benefits.

Cybersecurity issues
One of the biggest concerns with software-defined vehicles is the potential for cyber-attacks. Because these cars are connected to the internet, they are vulnerable to hacking and other forms of cybercrime. This could lead to serious safety issues, such as the car being controlled remotely by a hacker.

Recent development
Hyundai Motor Group stated in October 2022 that it will enter the Software-Defined Vehicle market by launching Software-Defined vehicles in electric and gasoline variants.
To capture the semiconductor section of the Software-Defined Vehicle market, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm started their new system on Chip (SOC) portfolios for Software-Defined vehicles named Drive Thor and Ride Flex SoC in September 2022.

The EV maker discussed plans involving Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. with the White House in recent days, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing private conversations. Tesla representatives sought clarity on the Inflation Reduction Act rules that the Biden administration is finalizing this week, according to some of the people. Rohan Patel, the company’s senior global director of public policy, was among those involved with the discussions, one of the people said.
Tesla wants to pursue a deal similar to one that Ford Motor Co. announced last month in Michigan with the battery maker, known as CATL, to construct a plant wholly owned by the US automaker, according to the people.
Representatives of Tesla, CATL and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Patel also didn’t respond.
CATL shares rose as much as 2.3% in early trading in Shenzhen on Friday.

Tesla is in expansion mode, deploying its $22 billion in cash to crank up production volumes and lower costs as it faces increased competition. CATL, which makes lithium iron phosphate batteries, a chemistry that is cheaper than the nickel-based batteries used in the West, is key to that plan.
The automaker is considering building the battery plant in Texas to supply its EV assembly plant there, though a location hasn’t been finalized, some of the people said. Like the Ford deal structure, Tesla would own and operate the factory while licensing the technology from CATL.
The auto industry has been lobbying to influence how the US Treasury Department will interpret requirements in President Joe Biden’s signature climate package. The law is intended to wean the US off its dependence on China for battery materials by incentivizing a US-based supply chain for EVs. One specific clause that has been the object of intense lobbying is 30D, which is designed to withhold consumer tax credits for EVs made with a certain amount of China-linked materials in their batteries.
Ford’s deal has provoked ire from lawmakers including Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who argue that it allows the Chinese company to benefit from US subsidies. Ford has said CATL wouldn’t receive any US tax dollars from the deal.
Barclays Plc analyst Dan Levy said in a research note that Tesla may get some political pushback to a deal with CATL, similar to what Ford has seen.

12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now,27-Mar-23,An American multinational automotive manufacturer Ford Motor Company (NYSE  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-consumer-cyclical-dividend-174146836.html,"In this article, we discuss 12 best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. 
Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.
Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&P 500.
Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.
The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.
In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.

Miller Value Partners mentioned Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:
“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS & Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”

11 Best Stocks to Buy on Robinhood for Beginners,29-Mar-23,Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)  in its Q3 2022 investor letter: ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners ·  Personal Finance...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-stocks-buy-robinhood-160035910.html,"In this article, we will take a look at the 11 best stocks to buy on Robinhood for beginners. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy on Robinhood for Beginners.
The retail investor activity that gained pace after the pandemic continues to lose gas amid the volatile macroeconomic situation. Retail investors who used platforms like Reddit and initiated trades on Robinhood suffered bruising losses after meme stocks started falling. This has caused a massive retreat of beginner investors from retail investing platforms. According to Vanda Research, in January 2023, trading activity of retail investors hit its lowest levels since January 2020. According to Wall Street Journal, data from Vanda Research says that average portfolio of the individual investors has fallen by 27% since touching peaks in December 2021. During the same period the S&P 500 index fell about 13%.
Retail Investors Retreat
According to data from Goldman Sachs, households are expected to pull a whopping $100 billion from the market this year. This would mark the first net outflow since 2018. Goldman Sachs noted that individual retail investors remain the biggest holders of US equities, and their exit from the market will pull support for major US companies, which are already suffering amid major stock declines.
The retreat of the individual investors from the market is evident from the declining number of visitors on stock trading platforms, the most important of which is Robinhood. Last month, Robinhood reported weak data for monthly active users for the sixth-straight quarter. The company said its monthly active users in February came in at 12 million, unchanged from the previous month.
The FOMO Rally
When the US stock market started to post huge gains earlier this year without any solid catalysts, some investors to quick to call it a bear market rally. In January, retail trading orders for stocks and ETFs accounted for a whopping 23% of the market’s total volume in late January. This was even more than the levels reached during the 2021 meme stock frenzy.
According to a Bloomberg report in February, Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said that the rally was based on FOMO (fear of missing out).
“People are just piling in going, ‘Crap, I missed it. I thought it was going to go down another 15%.’ We were overly pessimistic,” Forrest said at the time.
George Catrambone, head of Americas Trading at DWS, also reportedly said that investors should keep in mind that the “Fed is still hiking rates.”
“The danger here is that equities get too far out in front of earnings multiples and aren’t supportive of levels higher than here.”

These analysts was right. As subsequent data showed that inflation in the US is far from over and the Federal Reserve made clear that it plans to keep raising interest rates, the stocks started to fall again.

The projected fair value for Ford Motor is US$17.58 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Current share price of US$12.33 suggests Ford Motor is potentially 30% undervalued
The US$13.75 analyst price target for F is 22% less than our estimate of fair value
Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.

The Calculation
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 14%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$120b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$120b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$32b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$70b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$12.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

The Assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Ford Motor
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings.
Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.
Weakness
No major weaknesses identified for F.
Opportunity
Expected to breakeven next year.
Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.
Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.
Looking Ahead:
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Ford Motor, there are three essential aspects you should explore:
Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Ford Motor , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

The heavy trucks market consists of sales of 18-wheeler truck, refrigerator truck, dump truck, garbage truck, logging truck, concrete transport truck, tractor unit and tanker truck. Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers. The value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.

Heavy trucks are defined as commercial motor vehicles used for the transportation of goods with a weight of 2.72 tons or more when empty and 4.54 tons or more when loaded.

North America was the largest region in the heavy trucks market in 2022. Asia Pacific was the second-largest region in the heavy trucks market. The regions in the heavy trucks market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, Africa.

The main types in the heavy truck market are class 5, class 6, class 7, and class 8. Class 8 trucks refer to the class 8 trucks that are used commercially and have great load capacity. The various fuel types include diesel, natural gas, hybrid electric, and gasoline. These are used in construction and mining, freight and logistics, and other applications.

Growth in the demand for heavy trucks from end-users such as in construction, mining, and other sectors is contributing to the growth of the heavy truck manufacturing market. According to executives of leading truck makers, an increase in construction activities boosted the sales of tipper trucks, concrete mixers, and other heavy vehicles.
Also, the 2021, according to the American Trucking Association, the revenue of the trucking industry was reported to be $ 875.5 billion. In June 2021, around 4.06 million Class 8 trucks were in operation, 2.3% up from 2020. An increase in demand for heavy trucks from end-users is expected to drive the heavy truck market in the forecast period.

The COVID-19 outbreak across the globe has impacted the production and demand for heavy trucks, and this is expected to restrain the heavy truck market during the forecast period. The pandemic has led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of several manufacturing units to contain the disease. Such a lockdown norm has led to supply chain disruptions across several industries, including heavy truck manufacturing industries.
S&P Global Inc., a financial information and analytics company, indicated that global sales of heavy-duty trucks will decline by 20% to 30% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 impact. Furthermore, by 2021, the sales recovery is expected to be delayed by 10%. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is a major restraining factor that is expected to impact the growth of the heavy truck market negatively.

Vehicles fitted with advanced driver-assistive technologies and safety features are new trends in the heavy truck market. Advanced driver-assistive technologies include features like the Collision Mitigation System (CMS) and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS), aiming to reduce road accidents and increase vehicle safety.
For instance, in 2022, Tata Motors, an Indian-based, commercial vehicle manufacturer, launched India's first CNG-powered medium and heavy commercial vehicle truck and introduced a new-age, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) including collision mitigation system, lane departure warning system and driver monitoring system in its best-selling range of trucks including Prima, Signa and Ultra trucks to enhance driving comfort.

India’s obsession with small cars is fading.
With more spending power, car buyers are veering towards spacious four-wheelers, leaving global giants more desirous of a slice of the world’s third-largest car market.

“The increase in purchasing power and the growing middle class in India have resulted in higher disposable incomes,” Ashish Agarwal, director of Noida-based business management consultancy Acube Ventures, told Quartz.
“Another reason is the changing lifestyle and preferences of the Indian population, where people are now looking for more spacious and comfortable cars that can accommodate their families and luggage,” Agarwal said.

The world’s car makers are nodding in approval.
Global carmakers’ newfound love for India
In February, Japan’s Nissan announced investing $600 million in the country. In alliance with France’s Renault, it will begin making six new vehicles, including two new fully electric vehicles (EVs), here for both domestic and international markets. Renault-Nissan’s factory in southern India’s Chennai will also be upgraded as an international export hub.
The focus will be on high-quality SUVs and EVs for the Indian market, according to Ashwani Gupta, COO of Nissan Motor Co. Their EVs are expected to roll out in 2025.
“We are currently at below 50% capacity utilisation and are looking at scaling it up to 80% over a period of time. At present, we don’t have a plan to set up a new plant as we have got an excellent factory. But, of course, this site needs modernisation as we are going in for electrification of products,” Gupta had said in February.
Nissan’s announcement came a few days after a similar one by German automobile giant Volkswagen, declaring a Euro 1 billion plan to roll out new models, including SUVs and Sedans, in India.
“India is one of the most promising markets in the world but is also one of the most fiercely competitive. We want to be hyper-local here this time around and get the right products at the right prices to get our share here,” Volkswagen CEO Bernhard Maier told The Times of India in February.
South Korea’s Hyundai and British brand MG Motor, too, have plans for the country.
Hyundai is readying at least six EVs for India by 2028. These battery-operated EVs will cater to a mass customer base with a focus on “premium segments in India.” Some of these EV models will be in SUV style, the company’s India managing director and CEO SS Kim told the Press Trust of India in December 2021. Kona Electric is Hyundai’s only EV being sold in India now.
Meanwhile, in January this year, MG Motor announced a $100 million investment plan for India. Owned by China’s largest automaker Shanghai Automotive, it sells only SUVs in the country and has been steadily improving its market share since entering it in 2019.
Why are global car makers interested in India?
Something about India makes companies drool despite the failure of giants like General Motors and Ford.
One is that they are also looking to reduce their dependence on China, especially since the pandemic. Then there is the availability of a skilled workforce, along with India’s favorable investment climate, according to Agarwal of Acube Ventures.
Others agree and give credit to the business-friendly policies of the government of India, making foreign car makers’ products attractive enough.
“The rising disposable incomes of the middle class, increasing urbanization, and favorable government policies have all contributed to the growth of the Indian automotive industry,” said Siddharth Maurya, a resource specialist with expertise in fund management.
In 2021, the government has launched a subsidy scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and promote India as an alternative to China.
“The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Automobile and Auto component industry proposes financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology products and attract investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain,” the government has said.
So far, 115 companies have applied for the incentive scheme. These include Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Bharat Bosch, Toyota, and Mitsubishi.
Yet, the mood may not be celebratory for all stakeholders.
What’s bad about foreign car makers coming to India?
The primary question is, are India’s roads good enough to handle a larger number of cars, especially the big ones? The answer is not good enough even though things have improved over the years.
“India has a diverse network of roads ranging from narrow village lanes to multi-lane highways in cities, and while some of the roads are capable of accommodating bigger cars, many others are not,” said Maurya, the resource specialist.
“The increasing number of bigger cars has resulted in a higher demand for wider and more robust roads. However, building and expanding roads is a challenging task, especially in densely populated areas where land is scarce,” he said.
Companies also need to consider poor traffic management, the lack of proper signage, and indisciplined driving. Besides, India is home to some of the world’s most polluted cities. More internal combustion-engine vehicles will worsen the problem.
“Longer commute times, increased noise levels, and decreased mobility can all have negative effects on the well-being of people,” said Agarwal of Acube Ventures.

New Ram electric pickup can go up to 500 miles on a charge,05-Apr-23,Yahoo. Advertisement. Associated Press Finance. New ... company showed off  in January. But it's full of new technology. The Rev will...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ram-electric-pickup-500-miles-140844541.html,"DETROIT (AP) — An electric Ram pickup truck with up to 500 mile (800 kilometers) of range per charge and a battery-powered people-hauling Kia SUV are among the new vehicles being introduced Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show.
The two debuts in New York on Wednesday are among only nine automaker news conferences, far short of previous years. Many of the new models have been rolled out previously as automakers move away from auto shows and introduce new products virtually.
The Ram 1500 Rev joins pickups from Ford, General Motors, Rivian and Lordstown Motors in a field that’s growing increasingly crowded. Tesla is supposed to start selling its long-awaited Cybertruck later in the year.
The Ram looks more like the current gas-powered model than a more futuristic concept vehicle the company showed off in January. But it's full of new technology.
The Rev will come with a choice of two battery packs, the standard one with up to 350 miles (560 kilometers) of range and an optional larger pack with an expected range of 500 miles (800 kilometers).
The company says it also can tow up to 14000 pounds (6350 kilograms) and carry 2700 pounds (1,225 kilograms) in its bed. The 654-horsepower truck also can travel from zero to 60 mph (97 kilometers per hour) in 4.4 seconds, exceptionally quick for a vehicle that size.
Stellantis, which makes Ram vehicles, says the all-wheel-drive Rev can add up to 110 miles (177 kilometers) of range in about 10 minutes with a 350 kilowatt fast charger. The truck also is capable of powering worksite tools, sending power back to the grid or powering a home during an outage, the company says.
It's built on a new frame designed specifically for larger electric vehicles.
The truck isn't due in showrooms until the fourth quarter of 2024. The price will be announced closer to the on-sale date.
Stellantis says the truck will be built in the U.S., but it hasn't disclosed which factory. The company says that under current rules, the Ram Rev should qualify for a $7,500 U.S. electric vehicle tax credit. To qualify, vehicles must be assembled North America. Also, a certain percentage of battery minerals and parts must come from the U.S. or free trade partners.
Kia's new EV9 is a little longer than the automaker's popular gas-powered Telluride, and it can seat up to seven people in three rows of seats.
The EV9 comes with two powertrain options, a standard battery and rear-wheel-drive, and an optional larger battery that's expected to go 300 miles (480 kilometers) on a charge. All-wheel-drive also is an option.
Kia says the dual-motor GT line comes with 379 horsepower and can go from zero to 60 mph (97 kilometers per hour) in five seconds. The battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in under 25 minutes at a fast-charging station, Kia says.
The EV9 will hit U.S. showrooms late this year, and it's expected to be built at the company's plant in West Point, Georgia, starting next year. The automaker says it's reviewing requirements and doesn't know yet whether it will qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.
The EV9's price will be announced closer to the date it goes on sale.","{'negative': 0.5370474457740784, 'neutral': 0.8547341918945313, 'positive': 0.6025040745735168}",0.8547341918945313,0.6025040745735168,0.5370474457740784
Japan's SMBC CEO is watching out for chances to expand US ...,03-Apr-23,SMBC is a core banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG)  Japan's second-largest banking group after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.  ADVERTISEMENT.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-smbc-ceo-watching-chances-090727112.html,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Ritsuko Shimizu
TOKYO (Reuters) -The new head of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) said the Japanese bank is watching closely for chances to buy assets in the United States, adding that the latest banking crisis hasn't dented its confidence in the world's biggest capital market.
""The U.S. market will stay attractive"" despite the financial turbulence triggered by the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, Akihiro Fukutome, who was promoted from senior managing officer to chief executive on Saturday, told Reuters in an interview.
Fukutome ruled out the possibility of buying a U.S. bank as a whole but said the Japanese group would be looking at assets that may be offered for sale and a team of bankers managing those assets.
Credit Suisse Group AG's securitised products group last year, for instance, was among opportunities his team had explored, he said. U.S. buyout fund Apollo Global Management bought most of the business.
SMBC is a core banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan's second-largest banking group after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
In an effort to bolster its U.S. presence, SMFG has teamed up with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. SMFG bought nearly 5% of Jefferies shares in 2021 to boost its leveraged finance and cross-border M&A advisory businesses in the United States.
The CEO of SMFG, Jun Ohta, told Reuters recently that he intended to eventually raise his company's stake in Jefferies.
Fukutome also said the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank and its fallout have highlighted the stability of Japanese banks in the United States. SMBC has already received some funding inquires from domestic U.S. and Japanese companies operating there, he said.
""We are expecting more opportunities to come ahead where we can provide solutions,"" he said. ""Clients we helped during the global financial crisis have stayed with us since,"" he added, recalling the time around the Lehman Brothers bust, when he was working in New York.
Fukutome, 60, joined Mitsui Bank, one of SMBC's predecessor banks, in 1985 and had a three-year stint as president at Toyota Motor Corp's financial services unit from 2018, a rarity among Japanese bank chiefs.

Why Tesla is losing its dominance in the EV market,12-Apr-23,Ford General Motors and Nissan are gunning for Tesla. Here's why Elon  Musk ... The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model  2 but...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-losing-ev-dominance-151234275.html,"Tesla (TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.
While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins.
And they may just have success at that target practice.
Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack
“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.
The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.
Gap closed.
“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.
And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.
Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.
These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.
What's next for Tesla
Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive.
And more EV models, not from Tesla, are coming — and fast.
S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.
S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result.
The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.
General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year.
That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground.
Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%.
The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.
""In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move.""
RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a ""great way to really steal market share.""
Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%.
The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker. And perhaps a sign that mighty Tesla is losing its grip on an industry it has dominated for the last five years.
Either way, it will be electric for investors to bet on.

Don't want a Tesla? Here are your top 5 EV options,15-Apr-23,Yahoo Finance. Don't want a Tesla? Here are your top 5 EV ... Combined with  its Formula E motor inverter and battery technology the company...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-want-a-tesla-here-are-your-top-5-ev-options-172013414.html,"I get this question nearly every day. “Which EV should I buy if I don’t want a Tesla?”
Essentially the question comes from buyers who don’t want a Tesla (TSLA) because of the antics of CEO Elon Musk, don’t like the build quality of Tesla vehicles and parts and service issues, or just want something different than the ubiquitous Model 3 and Model Y SUV.
With that being said, here are my top choices in 5 different categories that dominate the American roadways.
The cheap EV - Chevrolet Bolt EUV
Chevrolet Bolt EUV (Chevrolet)
Starts at $27,800
Range: 247 miles
The 2023 Chevrolet (GM) Bolt is the cheapest EV you can buy in America — with a caveat. That caveat is the federal $7,500 EV tax credit which then makes it cheaper than the Nissan Leaf, which does not qualify for the tax credit.
That said, my choice in the cheap EV segment is the Bolt EUV, which is the larger crossover version of the Bolt, and starts at $27,800. The Bolt EUV has nearly 57 cubic feet of cargo space and slightly more than 39 inches of rear-seat legroom, quite a feat for a car with such a small footprint. With 247 miles on a full charge, the Bolt EUV has more than enough range for most American commuters, who will likely have to charge a couple times a week.
Inside, the car is appointed nicely with comfortable seats, and nice tech like dual digital displays and CarPlay (wireless!). Going up a trim level to premier gives you GM’s highly touted SuperCruise highway hands-free assistance tech and nice cabin materials like leather seats.
With a front-wheel motor setup, the car handles nicely in and around town with adequate power and agility with its low center of gravity. The Bolt EUV might be the perfect daily driver for those looking for a cheap commuter to gobble up miles.
The trusty sedan - Polestar 2
Polestar 2 US Launch August 2020 Copyright Free (Polestar / Beadyeye)
Starts at $48,400
Range: 270 miles (Long range single motor)
From the shores of Sweden comes the Polestar 2 sedan. On sale since 2020, the 2023 Polestar (PSNY) 2 features both a front-motor setup or dual motor all-wheel drive configuration, with the AWD version getting huge horsepower numbers (476 hp), but the single-motor version getting the longer range (270 miles).
At $48,400, the Polestar 2 is knocking on the door of the luxury segment, though its current price is essentially the average price for a new car in the U.S. Buyers get a lot for the money, however, with good looks, nice interior materials and fit and finish, and Google-powered tech for deep integration with infotainment and the car’s other systems.
When I drove the launch edition of the vehicle, the car felt light where it needed to be, with firm steering, and the ability to get you out of trouble quickly with a stab of the accelerator. It's a sporty little sedan, and for the 2024 model year the single-motor version moves the motor to the rear of the car for better performance, and Polestar is promising more range too.
America’s choice, the SUV - Ford Mustang Mach-E
Ford Mustang Mach-E is presented at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023. REUTERS/David 'Dee' Delgado (David Dee Delgado / reuters)
Starts at $45,995
Range: 247 miles (standard range battery and RWD)
The debate about whether this crossover SUV is a Mustang or not rages on, but the vehicle's sales are raging as well. Ford (F) sold another 5,500 Mach-E’s in the first quarter, and could have sold more, but the automaker was supply constrained due to downtime at the factory.
When I tested the car in 2021, the first year it was on sale, I wrote, “The Mach E, with its dual motor, AWD system is mighty impressive. Like most EVs, the acceleration is brisk right off the bat, and the Mach-E is no exception. What makes it even more of a standout is the chassis and suspension tuning.”
While that AWD version will set you back $51,000, the value-oriented standard range with rear-wheel drive setup gets you 247 miles of range, and a 0-60 mph time of 5.8 seconds, all for $45,995. And, the Mach-E qualifies for the federal EV tax credit of $7,500.
The pickup truck - Rivian R1T
The Rivian R1T pickup (Rivian)
Starts at $73,000
Range: 270 miles (dual motor, standard battery pack)
A bit of an aspirational play here, the Rivian R1T is more of an adventure truck than a work truck. But let’s be honest, most people these days are buying a pickup as a lifestyle choice.
In that vein, the Rivian (RIVN) is the perfect specimen. Clean lines, oodles of utility with a frunk and “gear tunnel,” and a near luxury-car interior give the Rivian the edge in the EV pickup space. Add capabilities like a quad-motor design, air suspension, and upcoming max battery pack and this truck can do it all—and it can drive like a sports car on the pavement with breakneck acceleration.
Whether Rivian can ramp up and meet demand is one of the bigger worries for the automaker. The dual motor version of the truck is coming this spring, sporting over 600hp and 270 miles of range with the standard battery pack. At $74,000, this version of the R1T also qualifies for the federal EV tax credit.
The luxury GT cruiser - Lucid Air
The Lucid Air Grand Touring (Lucid)
Starts at $87,400
Range: 410 miles (AWD equipped)
If you're in that market for a high-end, super-performing electric sedan, the Lucid (LCID) is an unbelievable package.
California-based Lucid made headlines years ago with the stunning design of its Air sedan. Combined with its Formula E motor, inverter, and battery technology, the company has the chops to make a legit luxury sport cruiser, and it has done so with the Air.
The Grand Touring Performance I tested earlier this year touted over 1000 hp, 514 miles of range, all packaged in a luxurious cabin that exceeded the levels of any EV-maker today. The power delivery from the powertrain was immense, though tuned in a way that made the drive sublime.
Though the company has sold its top trim levels like the Dream and Grand Touring thus far, Lucid’s Pure version of the car will be coming out soon, featuring a rear-wheel motor design, over 400 hp, and price tag of around $87,400.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cars-made-chinas-auto-valley-115700883.html,"WUHAN, China, April 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- On the evening of April 11, in front of the Yellow Crane Tower, a landmark ancient building in central Chinese city Wuhan, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, together with Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Commerce and the management committee of Wuhan Economic & Technological Development Zone (WEDZ), held an automobile tour exhibition to showcase the innovation achievements of Dongfeng's industrial upgrading and the strong competitiveness of the automobiles produced in the zone, also known as ""China's Auto Valley"".
Cars made in ""China's Auto Valley"" shine beyond central Chinese city Wuhan.
The Yellow Crane Tower was transformed into a 3D immersive full-motion stage, while thousands of buildings along the Yangtze River and Han River are full of flowing colors. The local Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain, the Turtle Mountain TV Tower and more than 40 barge docks along the rivers made up a ""giant screen"" that stretches for 25 km, creating a visual feast of light and shadow.
At the exhibition, 18 models of cars of Dongfeng's seven major series are on display. The event invited a corporate client and a consumer client to share their driving experience, while well-known online short-video celebrities livestreamed the exhibition with real-time interaction with the viewers, according to the Publicity Department of WEDZ and the Convergence Media Center of WEDZ.
From the production of Wuhan's first passenger car Citroen Fukang to the export of the city's first high-end new energy vehicle brand VOYAH, Dongfeng has been serving the city where it is based over the past three decades.
In recent years, Dongfeng has transformed itself into an outstanding technology firm, and built a brand matrix of new energy passenger vehicles including M-Hero, VOYAH, AEOLUS and Nano. It has key technologies such as automobile-grade chips and power systems, and basically completed the layout in new energy platforms, core technologies and key resources.
In 2022, Dongfeng sold 470,000 new energy vehicles, a year-on-year increase of 1.6 times.
Looking forward, Dongfeng will continue to implement the innovation-driven strategy, with more efforts made on strengthening, optimizing and expanding its own brands and new energy business, according to Feng Changjun, a senior management and chief accountant of Dongfeng Motor Corporation, adding that the company will keep improving its core competitiveness to build a world-class automobile maker.
During the exhibition, Chen Xiang, director of the WEDZ's culture and tourism bureau, tooted locally-produced cars by playing the conductor of the light symphony orchestra with a dancing baton. Twelve VOYAH cars flashed their lights in front of the Yellow Crane Tower in an orchestrated pattern, promoting the car brands nurtured in the zone.
VOYAH has developed SUV, MPV and sedan vehicles within three years, which is the most complete product layout among Chinese new energy vehicle enterprises, said Lu Fang, the company's CEO, adding that more and better automobiles will be rolled out as VOYAH continues to thrive in the zone.
""Consumption is an important engine of economic growth,"" said Liu Ziqing, the top official with WEDZ and a senior official of Wuhan.
The zone will continue to hold the tour exhibition of automobiles made in ""China's Auto Valley"" in the future in a bid to further boost consumer confidence, release consumption potential and promote the recovery and stabilization of the automobile market, Liu said.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) share price is 143% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. But it's down 5.7% in the last week. But note that the broader market is down 0.2% since last week, and this may have impacted Ford Motor's share price.
While the stock has fallen 5.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Ford Motor was able to grow its EPS at 73% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. However, extraordinary items have impacted recent EPS numbers. The average annual share price increase of 34% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

We know that Ford Motor has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Ford Motor's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
What About Dividends?
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ford Motor's TSR for the last 3 years was 168%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
A Different Perspective
We regret to report that Ford Motor shareholders are down 15% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 3.6%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Ford (F) Deepens Ties With China Plans to Import Lincoln SUVs,19-Apr-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-deepens-ties-china-105510279.html,"Ford F is set to import its restyled Lincoln Nautilus sport-utility vehicles from China to the United States, marking a significant shift in its manufacturing strategy. This move comes as other U.S. companies are distancing themselves from China. The sleeker, hybrid-powered SUV will be the first model Ford imports from its Hangzhou plant, a joint venture with China's Changan Automobile, which already manufactures the Nautilus for the Chinese market.
The 2024 midsize Lincoln Nautilus SUV, which features a 48-inch dashboard display and an internal combustion engine, is set to hit the U.S. market in the first quarter of 2024, with a starting price of $51,810. Lincoln plans to electrify its entire fleet by 2030, with four electric vehicles currently in development.
Currently, the Nautilus is being produced for the U.S. market at Ford's Oakville Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada. However, the automaker recently announced a CAD 1.8 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) investment to transform the facility into an electric vehicle hub, prompting the shift in production to China.
Though importing vehicles from China is not without precedent, it has often drawn public and political criticism, particularly during periods of heightened tension between the two countries. For instance, General Motors GM has faced backlash for importing its Buick Envision crossover from China since 2016.
GM has sold over 200,000 vehicles produced in China, a move that has been labeled as an ""Invasion"" and ""a slap in the face"" by American union representatives.
Despite potential criticism, importing the Nautilus from China could make good business sense for Ford. According to a Lincoln spokesperson, centralizing Nautilus production in China for both markets enables the company to achieve manufacturing efficiencies while retooling the Oakville facility for next-generation electric vehicles.
This announcement comes on the heels of a Ford report highlighting the company's position as the top automaker in terms of vehicles assembled and hourly autoworkers employed in America, as well as vehicles exported from the U.S. to other countries.
The 2024 Nautilus will feature a redesigned exterior, new interior with door-to-door screens, and a unique feature called ""Lincoln Rejuvenate,"" which offers a multisensory in-cabin experience with lighting and digital scenting. While the concept was introduced in China, the Nautilus will be the first U.S. production car to incorporate these features.
The Nautilus will be powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and a hybrid powertrain, with sale prices ranging from $51,810 to $75,860. The introduction of the redesigned Nautilus and ""Lincoln Rejuvenate"" comes as the once-prominent luxury brand seeks to revitalize its image, following a 4% drop in Lincoln vehicle sales in the U.S. last year to just under 83,500 units, compared to a peak of over 112,200 in 2019.
In conclusion, Ford's decision to import the Lincoln Nautilus SUV from China represents a strategic move that may offer manufacturing efficiencies and support its transition to electric vehicle production. However, the company may face public and political criticism for deepening its ties with China, particularly given the current geopolitical climate. Investors should watch Ford's performance in the luxury segment and the overall market response to this decision as the automaker works to rejuvenate the Lincoln brand.

By Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas
April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday as disappointing results from Tesla, AT&T and some regional banks dented investor sentiment already soured by prospects of further interest rate hikes.
Wall Street has remained steady this week with mixed earnings from U.S. banks allaying contagion concerns stemming from bank failures last month, but rapidly rising rates and recession worries have dimmed lenders' outlook.
Tesla Inc tanked 8.7% to touch its lowest in more than a month after its first-quarter gross margin missed expectations due to aggressive price cuts on its vehicles and as CEO Elon Musk has put sales growth ahead of profit.
""Tesla is and has been struggling. They've been cutting prices pretty regularly and that's not something that you do if the market is strong for your product,"" said Paul Nolte, market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.
Losses in Tesla and other carmakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co led to a 1% drop in consumer discretionary stocks.
Consumer staples, a defensive sector, was the only gainer in an otherwise weak market.
AT&T Inc slid 9.4% as the wireless carrier missed estimates for first-quarter revenue, while American Express Co slipped 3.2% on missing first-quarter earnings expectations.
Gains of 7% each in chip company Lam Research after it beat third-quarter revenue estimates and homebuilder D.R. Horton following its upbeat full-year revenue forecast helped cut some losses in the broader market.
Analysts have largely retained last week's expectations of a near-5% year-on-year fall in quarterly profits at S&P 500 companies, according to Refinitiv data.
Traders are reassessing the path for interest rates after data indicated that a slowdown in the U.S. economy was not enough to push the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates as early as this year. Comments from Fed policymakers this week have also supported bets on further policy tightening.
Investors see an 88% chance of the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points next month, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool, but they have also priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.
Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased moderately last week, suggesting that the labor market was gradually slowing, while another set of numbers showed factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region slumped more than expected in April.
""The momentum of the data is shifting toward weaker economic growth and the argument in favor of a Fed pause is increasing,"" David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation.
Adding to worries, the cost of insuring exposure to U.S. sovereign debt rose to the highest level since 2011 over market jitters that the government could hit its debt ceiling sooner than expected.
At 11:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.16 points, or 0.28%, at 33,800.85, the S&P 500 was down 18.73 points, or 0.45%, at 4,135.79, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 49.15 points, or 0.40%, at 12,108.07.
IBM Corp gained 1.6% after the software company beat estimates for first-quarter profit.
Among regional banks, Zions Bancorp, Truist Financial Corp and KeyCorp dropped between 2.2% and 5.5% after their quarterly profits missed estimates.

Tesla margins in focus as EV price war kicks into high gear,17-Apr-23,It has come under pressure as rivals such as Ford Motor Co have stepped up  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-margins-focus-ev-price-103046052.html,"By Akash Sriram
(Reuters) -Tesla Inc's first-quarter margins are anticipated to have hit a more than three-year low as the electric-vehicle maker slashed prices to lure more buyers in the face of rising competition and a weak economy.
The world's most valuable automaker, which commands over half of the U.S. EV market, cut sticker prices on its cars five times between January and April - a move that boosted quarterly sales in the quarter ended March 31 but squeezed its industry-leading profit margin.
Tesla is expected to report auto gross margin of 23.2% for the quarter on Wednesday, according to 17 analysts polled by Visible Alpha, down from a record 32.9% a year earlier and the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2019.
Finance chief Zachary Kirkhorn promised in January that Tesla would not go below margins of 20% and an average selling price of $47,000 across models. Analysts, however, predict further price cuts and margin pressure.
""While many investors have been hopeful that Q1 margins might be (at their) bottom, we don't believe that will necessarily be the case, particularly given our expectation that further cuts are likely,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.
The company on Friday slashed prices in Europe, Israel and Singapore. In the United States, Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction in its base Model Y.
It has come under pressure as rivals such as Ford Motor Co have stepped up competition at home, even as consumers cut back spending on recession worries, while in China, Tesla's second-largest market, it is playing catch up with BYD.
Tesla faced trouble at its Shanghai factory on Monday, after employees were informed about the company's plans to cut their performance bonuses, which are linked to the factory's performance, according to online posts and workers.
The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said a ramp up in production at its factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin would help improve margins due to economies of scale.
Tesla is also likely to benefit from a plunge in lithium prices this year, especially in China, where a slump in demand for EVs has left stocks of the metal piling up.
""It's probable that Tesla's margins will be preserved based on the reduction in commodity costs,"" said George Gianarikas, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.
Tesla is targeting deliveries of 1.8 million vehicles this year, though Musk said in January the automaker could hand out 2 million vehicles if circumstances are favorable.
The company's shares have gained about 50% this year. They lost 65% of their value last year.

Electric Pickups Could Be The Game Changer In The EV Universe
Undoubtedly, China, Europe and the U.S. are powering ahead towards an EV future. The features of these vehicles are all about tech and software, while combustion engine vehicles were all about the mechanics and hardware. But, electric pickups go even further than that, perhaps because they promise to redefine the way we think about pickups in general. these vehicles promise to boost the self-confidence of inexperienced drivers as they will be the perfect companion both on and off-roads. With Worksport’s Terravis solar powered covers and COR portable battery, pickup drivers will be able to power remote locations and upgrade their camping trips in an emissions-free manner. Without components of internal combustion engines, pickups will offer massive storage spaces. Therefore, perhaps it’s not an overstatement to say that this year’s EV success rests on the shoulders of electric pickups as 2023 has already been dubbed as the year of the electric pickup and for good reason.

Military Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) And Electric Vehicle (EV) Market - Market Dynamics
Major Drivers & Challenges- The market is driven by factors such as the push toward the adoption of green (eco-friendly) vehicles., stringent regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency, and the increasing sales of HEVs. However, high total cost of ownership of HEVs is hindering market growth.
A key driver in the military hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV) that is expected to fuel the market growth is the push toward the adoption of green (eco-friendly) vehicles. Some of the important solutions to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to acceptable levels include the development and introduction of green cars and vehicles. HEVs and EVs run on only electricity, hybrid power, and other energy sources such as solar, wind, and biofuels. The government incentives and tax credits attract automobile manufacturers to invest in military HEV and EV production expansion in their region. Additionally, it is also believed that the green vehicle push will drive the military HEV and EV market to higher growth, covering large shares of the global military hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV) market during the forecast period.
A major challenge for the growth of the market is the high cost of ownership of HEVs. Military HEVs have a higher total cost of ownership than conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles due to their use of advanced electronic components and design considerations, as well as the additional high-capacity batteries used in military HEVs. The cost depends on mileage provided, hours of use, fuel cost, and government subsidies. For instance, one of the best-selling economic hybrid vehicles, the Nissan Leaf, has a 24 kWh battery that costs USD 12,000; in this amount, a plush sedan model of an ICE car can be availed. Hence, such factors will hinder market growth during the forecast period.
Key Trends- High-density, high-power, and small-size li-ion batteries are some of the opportunities for the market players to grow. On the other hand, the cost-to-weight ratio high for hybrid vehicles than for ice vehicles is a huge challenge in front of the industry.
To facilitate electric drive functions when the engine is off, current hybrid systems include heavily built battery packs. It can supply the energy needed for acceleration, recharging is done by regenerative braking, and it doesn't deplete much. But this electric propulsion function is required only for a small portion of the time when the engine works in the inefficient range, which is while starting and sudden acceleration of the vehicle. Hence, the heavy battery pack gives no additional benefits. Moreover, the heavy battery packs take more time to recharge and unlike EVs, HEVs must be recharged through the engine and regenerative braking. Thus, the efficiency of an HEV depends on the time rate at which energy can be taken out or pushed back into the battery pack and not on the electric drive mode, which can be achieved with small-size and high-density battery packs.

Verizon Communications (VZ) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should  Know,17-Apr-23,Investors Heavily Search Ford Motor Company (F): Here is What You Need to  Know ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-vz-outpaces-stock-214509635.html,"Verizon Communications (VZ) closed the most recent trading day at $39.46, moving +0.61% from the previous trading session. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.33%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.92%.
Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. cellphone carrier had gained 6.61% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.45% and outpacing the S&P 500's gain of 5.67% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Verizon Communications as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. On that day, Verizon Communications is projected to report earnings of $1.19 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 11.85%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $33.78 billion, up 0.69% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.70 per share and revenue of $137.48 billion. These totals would mark changes of -9.27% and +0.47%, respectively, from last year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Verizon Communications. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.26% higher. Verizon Communications is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Verizon Communications has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.35 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.25.
Also, we should mention that VZ has a PEG ratio of 2.01. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

China EV Price War Reaches Fever Pitch: An Analysis,18-Apr-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Boyd Gaming  Corporation ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto  · Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-ev-price-war-reaches-142902732.html,"A full-blown electric vehicle (EV) price war has erupted in China. U.S. EV king Tesla TSLA has sparked an EV price war in China that has resulted in massive price cuts by various automakers in the world’s largest car market. It all started in October when Tesla cut the prices of its popular models in China. The discounts were further escalated in January that made locally-produced cars up to 14% less expensive than 2022. In some cases, the prices of cars in China were around 50% cheaper than in the United States and Europe.
To keep up with the stiff competition, intensified by Tesla’s steep price reductions, rivals were left with little option but to follow the EV behemoth’s footsteps. Not only China-based EV makers like NIO Inc. NIO, XPeng Inc. XPEV and BYD Co Ltd BYD followed suit, legacy automakers including Ford F, Volkswagen and others also joined the EV price war bandwagon.
BYDDY currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). TSLA and XPEV are #3 Ranked (Hold) each, while F and NIO carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) currently.
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Mad Rush to Slash Prices
China’s EV industry has experienced exponential growth since 2020, with sales doubling last year, in part due to government subsidies. However, with the subsidy program expiring in December 2022, competition has intensified in the EV space. This has resulted in a crowded market, with companies vying to attract buyers. In addition to that, an uncertain macro environment has started to hurt vehicle demand in the world’s biggest car market. China’s car sales dwindled 13% in the three months ending March 2023. While sales of gas-powered ICE vehicles plunged, growth in EV sales also slowed down, per the China Passenger Car Association.
It’s also worth noting here traditional automakers are facing the challenge of selling off their older inventory of diesel- and gas-powered vehicles before stricter national emissions standards come into effect in July, which will make it harder to sell these vehicles.
To remain competitive in the market, carmakers are taking drastic measures by not just offering steep discounts but also providing incentives such as giveaways at dealerships after China phased out its nationwide subsidies for EVs at the end of last year.
So far this year, more than 40 carmakers in China have discounted both electric and gas-powered vehicles. These discounts vary from several hundred dollars for more affordable models to tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings.According to data compiled by China Auto Market, approximately 20% of the available passenger cars witnessed price reductions exceeding 10,000 yuan ($1,500) in the country during the first quarter of 2023.
Automakers Join Tesla-Fueled Price War
Amid a bleak vehicle demand outlook in China due to economic worries, Tesla cut prices of its models last October, reversing a string of price hikes over the past two years. Prices of Models 3 and Y were cut by around 10% in October. And just in less than three months, TSLA again slashed prices of Models 3 and Y in January 2023 by as much as 13.5%.
Tesla's decision to deepen discounts in China for the second time in January came after a drop in December deliveries of its locally produced vehicles, marking the lowest figures in five months. Additionally, the end of Beijing's subsidy program, which played a crucial role in spurring EV sales in China, resulted in Tesla slashing its sticker prices to boost sales and eventually fueling a price war in the country.
Tesla’s steep price reductions prompted other automakers to follow suit amid cut-throat competition. China’s EV maker XPengreduced prices for its G3i SUV, P5 sedan, and P7 sedan models by as much as 13% in January. In a statement to InsideEVs, XPeng cited “The move will increase the competitiveness of our current products, allowing a broader spectrum of users to experience the intelligent features, and creating a more favorable momentum ahead of our new product launches.”
XPeng’s close peer NIO also started offering discounts of up to 100,000 yuan ($14,900) on some models to boost sales. Per local media reports, NIO started slashing prices of the 2022 ES6, ES7 and ES8 in February.
Shenzhen-based BYD implemented its first major price reduction of 2023 in February. Specifically, the company reduced the price of its 2021 Han EV model by 20,000 RMB in Beijing, while the 2021 Qin EV experienced a price cut of 15,000 RMB. The discount rate for newer models ranges from 6,000 to 8,000 RMB.
Legacy automakers like Ford and Volkswagen, BMW AG and Toyota among others also joined the EV price war bandwagon in China. In response to Tesla’s price cuts in October, Ford reduced the prices of the Mustang Mach-E in China by up to 28,000 yuan at the end of October.  In March, the company again slashed the prices of the model in China by a substantial 40,000 yuan.
In a bid to attract price-sensitive customers to its offerings, Germany-based carmaker Volkswagen slashed the prices of its ID series EVs in China last month. The carmaker’s two ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen and SAIC-Volkswagen, offered discounts of up to 20%, or 40,000 yuan on battery-powered sport-utility vehicles (SUVs). Close peer BMW is also offering substantial discounts on its i3 EV, which can result in savings of up to 100,000 yuan. Precisely, the auto biggie is offering 30% discount on its i3's sticker price of 353,900 yuan.
Japan’s top automaker Toyota cut prices of its bZ4X electric SUV in China by 30,000 RMB in February. After the 15% price cut, the Toyota bZ4X starts at 169,800 RMB ($24,660).
“The severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I’ve never seen,” said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights.
A Shakeout in the Cards?
The intense price war by companies to secure market share is causing significant disruption in China’s auto market. The China Association of Automobile Manufactures doesn’t view this price-cutting spree as a long-term fix to ebbing sales and accumulation of inventory. Many industry watchdogs are of the view that this intensifying EV price war that the situation may result in will wipe out financially weaker automakers and/or lead to potential partnerships and consolidations among Tesla's competitors.
In order to maintain sales volumes, EV makers are feeling the pressure to reduce prices but can they really afford it? Most of the EV upstarts are struggling financially and are not profitable yet. Such price cuts may further clip margins. While some companies may suffer reduced profit margins, others will likely accept greater losses to sustain their sales figures. While big EV makers like Tesla and BYD can afford to get aggressive with price reductions, smaller and not so financially sound rivals may find it difficult to keep up with this price war.
Wall Street predicts that the market will experience a ""survival-of-the-fittest"" shakeout, with only a few dominant electric vehicle players remaining, while weaker brands fade away.
Who is Benefitting From This Price War?
It is not the carmakers who are reaping the benefits of this price war. As Tesla is set to report earnings tomorrow, analysts are expecting the company’s margins to shrink amid price cuts. The price war is taking its toll on even the most resilient of EV makers. Lest we forget, BYD suffered an $18 billion wipeout in value in February amid the Tesla-ignited EV price war.
With near-term prospects of such strong companies getting muted, we can’t expect the relatively smaller EV players to tackle the current scenario well. It is also difficult for legacy automakers like Ford, whose EV business is still not profitable.
What’s worse is that the EV price war hasn’t ended yet. In fact, more price cuts by EV makers are expected in China as the competition is even more cut-throat now. Per Fitch Rating, the price war in China's car market is likely to extend into the second quarter and erode profitability along the entire automobile value chain in 2023.
At this crucial point, if anyone is on the winning side, it’s the consumers. As a potential EV buyer in 2023, it is you who can benefit from the price war in the face of increasing competition among automakers as more EVs enter the market. With the market already featuring a vast selection of brands and more than 150 new electric cars and plug-in hybrids set to be launched in 2023, consumers will be spoilt for choices, and that too at much more affordable sticker prices.

Tesla tumbles as investors balk at Musk's price-cutting spree,20-Apr-23,Ford Motor Co and General Motors each lost about 3% Lucid Group slumped  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-shares-sink-musk-signals-125229658.html,"By Aditya Soni and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's stock tumbled nearly 10% on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk signaled the electric vehicle maker will keep cutting prices to drive up demand, even after taking a painful hit to margins.
The leading electric car manufacturer lost over $50 billion of its stock market value, while fears of an escalating price war also hit the shares of General Motors , Volkswagen AG and other automakers.
At $517 billion, Tesla's market capitalization ended Thursday below Meta Platforms' for the first time since 2021.
GRAPHIC: Musk's price war sinks Tesla shares to January low https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkdlgjovm/Pasted%20image%201682019892028.png
""Tesla’s room to lower prices is not just limited to shrinking its superior margins; the EV maker seems conceptually ready to give away its hardware in the near-term in hopes of richly monetizing its software in a more distant future,"" Deutsche analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a client note.
Tesla's gross margins fell in the first quarter to the lowest in more than two years, missing Wall Street's estimates after the company ignited a global price war in January to defend its dominance in the U.S. and make inroads in China, its second-largest market.
Tesla's automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits and leasing, stood at 18.3%, missing an 'above 20%' target provided in January by Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn.
Tesla has already slashed prices six times this year and Musk suggested more such cuts ahead, saying the company will put sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.
""We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and a higher margin,"" Musk said.
At least 15 analysts cut their Tesla price targets following Tesla's report, pulling the median target of 42 analysts from $210 down to $200, or about 23% above the stock's current level, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors dumped automaker shares from Europe to the United States on fears that they too will sacrifice margins to maintain market share.
Ford Motor Co and General Motors each lost about 3%, Lucid Group slumped about 7%.
France-based Renault SA, whose finance chief said the company will not drastically cut prices on its EVs amid Tesla's downward ""spiral"", dropped 8%. Germany's Volkswagen fell 3.1%.
Tesla remains up 32% year to date, far outperforming the S&P 500's 8% rise.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s first-quarter earnings per share has moved north by 2 cents in the past seven days.

The U.S. auto biggie missed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter amid lower-than-expected profits from all but the International Markets Group unit. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford surpassed earnings estimates once and missed on the other three occasions, the average surprise being 9.34%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Q4 Highlights
Ford’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings came in at 51 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. The bottom line rose 96.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 26 cents. The company’s consolidated fourth-quarter revenues came in at $44 billion, rising 17% year over year. Revenues from the Automotive segment increased 18% to $41.8 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.4 billion.

Ford reported an adjusted free cash flow of $2.4 billion during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $25,134 million as of Dec 31, 2022, compared with $20,540 million on Dec 31, 2021. The automotive long-term debt increased to $19.2 billion from $17.2 billion as of the end of 2022.
Things to Note Ahead of Q1 Release
The Automotive segment is the biggest contributor to Ford’s consolidated revenues. A huge part of Ford’s overall performance is attributable to the performance of the Automotive segment, which appears impressive with its strong vehicle line-up of F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport and Edge.

Ford’s first-quarter revenues are likely to have been aided by a projected increase in total wholesale units. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total wholesale shipments worldwide is pegged at 1,015,000 units, indicating an increase from 966,000 units in the year-ago period. The consensus mark for first-quarter revenues from automotive sales is $34,436 million, implying an uptick from $32,111 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EBIT from the segment is pegged at $2,219 million, implying growth from $1,891 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022.

The consensus mark for revenues from Ford Credit is pegged at $2,277 million, implying a decrease from $2,281 million. The consensus mark for adjusted EBIT from the segment is $374 million, suggesting a fall from $928 million in the first quarter of 2022.

The consensus mark for revenues from Ford Mobility is pegged at $50 million, implying a decline from $84 million. The consensus mark for loss before interest and taxes from the segment is $209 million.

While estimates for Ford Credit and Mobility segments suggest a year-over-year decline, automotive revenues growth is likely to more than offset the decline in the to-be-reported quarter.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford for the to-be-reported quarter, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

Earnings ESP: Ford has an Earnings ESP of +5.27%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 2 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).
Other Stocks With the Favorable Combination
Let’s take a look at some other players from the auto space that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:

BorgWarner Inc. BWA will release first-quarter 2023 results on May 4. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank #3.

LG Energy Solution Q1 profit more than doubles on U.S. gains,25-Apr-23,... Ford Motor Co and Chinese battery maker CATL. ADVERTISEMENT.  Advertisement. LG ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lg-energy-solution-q1-profit-005952549.html,"By Heekyong Yang and Hyunsu Yim
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's LG Energy Solution said on Wednesday quarterly profit more than doubled, as the battery maker benefited from subsidies from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and solid U.S. sales of electric vehicles.
Its shares jumped as its earnings met forecasts.
The company, which supplies Tesla Inc, General Motors Co and others, said it had received requests from major automaker clients about boosting battery supply since the U.S. law took effect, which could lead to additional orders.
LG Energy Solution (LGES) reported an operating profit of 633 billion won ($472.6 million) for the January-March period, up 145% from 259 billion won a year earlier.
That was in line with an average analyst forecast of 633 billion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Analysts attributed the jump in profit to solid sales of EVs in the United States, where EV consumers can receive a tax credit of up to $7,500 under the Inflation Reduction Act.
When asked about rival Chinese battery makers' efforts to enter the U.S. market, LGES Chief Financial Officer Lee Chang-sil said the company would maintain its competitive position in the U.S.
He cited the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at weaning the United States off dependence on China for EV battery components, as a reason for that advantage.
In a further boost for LGES, U.S. senators want to pass legislation to block tax credits for EV batteries produced using Chinese technology, taking aim at a partnership between Ford Motor Co and Chinese battery maker CATL.
LG Energy Solution's revenue for the quarter doubled to 8.7 trillion won, LG Energy said in a regulatory filing. Second-quarter sales revenue was likely to hold steady, despite any impact from metal prices, it said.
LGES said revenue in the second half of the year could fall with lower metals input prices as it had signed contracts with customers on ""cost pass-through"" terms to manage materials costs, however the impact on profitability would be limited.
About 80% of EVs that are eligible for U.S. tax credits use batteries from South Korea's three major cell makers - LGES, Samsung SDI Co Ltd and SK On, according to an analysis from brokerage Korea Investment & Securities.
Shares of LG Energy Solution (LGES), carved out of LG Chem Ltd last year, rose as much as 2.4% in morning trade, outpacing a flat broader KOSPI market.

General Motors Races Ahead In Its Effort To Catch Up To Tesla,26-Apr-23,CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance that GM targets to produce 50000 ...  GM is joined Ford Motor (NYSE: F) who entered the list with its electric  version...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-races-ahead-effort-145435979.html,"On April 25th, General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its first quarter revenue rose but profits dipped, while improving its full-year forecast. Both top and bottom lines exceeded Wall Street’s expectations with cost-cutting efforts GM made showing results sooner than expected.
Key First Quarter Figures
Revenue for the quarter rose 11.1% YoY as it amounted to $39.9 billion while net income dropped 18.5% to a bit less than $2.4 billion while adjusted EBIT dropped 6% to $3.8 million.
Excluding some dividend payouts, net income attributable to stockholders fell 18.5% from 2022’s comparable quarter to about $2.4 billion. Along with the employee buyout program, GM also spent $99 million on buying out Buick dealers that did not want to invest in EVs as part of its strategy to accelerate its EV progress. A similar deal was offered to Cadillac dealers back in 2020.
Full Year Outlook
The largest U.S. automaker by sales raised its expectations for 2023. Adjusted earnings are expected in the range between $11 billion to $13 billion, or $6.35 to $7.35 a share. The prior range was between $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion, or between $6 and $7 a share. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is now expected to be in a range between $5.5 billion and $7.5 billion, while the previously forecasted range was between $5 billion and $7 billion. However, net income attributable to shareholders was lowered due to an announced employee buyout program in the amount of $875 million. It is now expected in the range between $8.4 billion and $9.9 billion, while it was previously expected to be in the range between $8.7 billion to $10.1 billion. GM expects to achieve its $2 billion cost reduction goal this year.
What is a potential risk is the expiration of the contract with the United Auto Workers Union that is due in the fall. Before the current deal was reached back in 2019, it was preceded by a six-week strike. Barra did not comment on the upcoming talks.
Supercharging In An Effort To Catch Up To Tesla
CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance that GM targets to produce 50,000 vehicles by the end of the first half of the year, aiming to double its EV production in the second half of the year.
Not Joining Tesla In Discounting Prices
GM is still not interested to enter in the price war that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) started earlier this year, with Jacobson saying that management feels good with the current pricing positioning.
GM ‘owns’ the list of most electric vehicles eligible for both tax incentives
General Motors is leading the list with most vehicles that qualify for the full $7,500 tax reduction under the Inflation Reduction Act. GM is joined Ford Motor (NYSE: F) who entered the list with its electric version of the F-150 pickup, the Lightning in both standard and extended range, Stellantis N.V.(NYSE: STLA) Chrysler Pacifica PHEV and of course, Tesla with its Model 3 performance and Model Y performance, all-wheel drive and long-range all-wheel drive. Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) also made the cut with its ID.4 that retained eligibility for the full $7,500 credit after switching the battery supplier. The cheapest Tesla Model 3, Ford’s Mustang Mach E in both ranges and both of Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN)’s R1T pickup and R1S SUV only qualified for the $3,750 half credit. A few manufacturers vanished from the list with the newest requirements, such as Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (OTC: NSANY) with its fully electric Nissan Leaf and Genesis G70 as well as Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (OTC: BMWYY) with its BMW 330e and BMW X5 xDrive45e.
Pulling The Plug On Its First Mass Market EV
Despite posting record sales in the first quarter of 2023, General Motors revealed that it will no longer be producing its Chevy Bolt after this year. Both the model released in late 2016 and the larger Electric Utility Vehicle introduced in 2021 are both being axed and it is not because of lack of demand as sales have been record high. It is because the older design and chemistry used in batteries is outdated with newer battery packs being 40% cheaper.
Joining Forces With Samsung SDI
Also on Tuesday, but in a separate announcement, General Motors revealed that together with Samsung, it will build a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States that should be operational next year. Together, GM and Samsung, will invest more than $3 billion as the produced battery cells will help GM scale its North America EV capacity to more than 1 million units per year, which is the current target it aims to reach by 2025.
All in all, General Motors is feeling confident about 2023 as continues its path of playing catch-up with Tesla with CEO Mary Barra claiming 2023 will be the breakout year for the company’s electric lineup. Despite strong results and a hiked guidance, GM’s shares dropped 3% upon results.

12 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2023,26-Apr-23,Data from Bank of America shows that retail investors bought the dip in  January which was one of the worst since the financial crisis. ... Ford  Motor Company (...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-popular-retail-investor-182453995.html,"In this article, we will take a look at the 12 most popular retail investor stocks in 2023. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2023.
The coronavirus pandemic and the market dynamics that followed infused huge changes in financial markets all over the world. One of the biggest such changes was the rise of retail investors. Flushed with disposable income and having access to platforms like Reddit, Robinhood, Stock Twits and social media in general, individual investors launched bets and showed their power by banding together to buy stocks shorted by hedge funds. Soon, retail investors became a power to reckon with, and played a key role in the overall movements of stock markets. Today, notable investment firms and institutional investors pay attention to what retail investors are up to.  An important factor noted in the retail investor space is that most of these investors are young. These investors, equipped with the right set of tools and education, could make a huge mark in the stock markets. A World Economic Forum report says that about 70% of retail investors in a  2022 survey were under 45. The report said that a whopping 74% of retail investors say that they would likely invest more if they had more opportunities to learn about investing. Another important data point says that 55% of retail investors learned about investing after entering the job market, while less than 10% of them learned about investing in early schooling.
One of the latest and noteworthy moves by retail investors came after the SVB collapse. Surprisingly they piled into shares of large banks as small banks started to falter and Americans began to move their cash away from small banks to larger banks. According to data from VandaTrack, during the five-day period ending March 16, retail investors bought about $1 billion worth of stocks of major banks including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Citigroup. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan.
It seems retail investors are big into buy-the-dip strategies. Data from Bank of America shows that retail investors bought the dip in January, which was one of the worst since the financial crisis. On the other hand, institutional investors sold off assets during the month.
Talking to Yahoo Finance, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said the following on this trend:
""'Buy the dip' has been a strategy that's worked since there have been markets. You know, a lot of investors have been trained to realize that buying the dip works.""
Another important trend seen gaining traction among retail investors is index investing. According to an FTSE Russell report:
“Our survey indicates that the multi-year shift to index-based strategies looks set to continue in 2023, with a high rate of net ETF inflows. That contrasts with conventional wisdom that index strategies prosper in buoyant but not turbulent markets. Suggesting that 2023 will be another year of investors favoring index-based strategies, nearly four in ten (38%) U.S. retail investors who hold indexes plan to add to their investments in these strategies.”

Our Methodology
For this article we used the Robinhood Investor Index to see what are the most popular retail investor stocks in 2023. The Robinhood Investor Index, launched in 2022, is designed to track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. As Robinhood has over 11 million monthly active users, it’s perhaps the best platform the find out which stocks are popular among retail investors. The Robinhood Investor Index shows the 10 most popular stocks on the platform, so we took two additional stocks for this list by scouring the Wall Street Bets subreddit and picking two stocks that were the most talked about (with positive sentiment) over the past few days through April 17. To give you hedge fund sentiment for these stocks well, we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors for each of these stocks.
Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2023
12. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14
GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) shares have gained about 30% year to date. Most of these gains came in March after GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) posted strong Q4 results, crushing analyst estimates. GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter came in at $0.16, beating estimates by $0.29. Revenue in the period totaled $2.23 billion, beating estimates by $50 million.
As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 14 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was Kenneth Mario Garschina’s Mason Capital Management which owns a $21 million stake in the company.
11. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19
Shares of AI company C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) have gained 100% in value in 2023 through April 17 because of the AI mania that started this year on the back of the ChatGPT launch. It is one of the most popular retail investor stocks in 2023. However, C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) lost value after a short report by Kerrisdale Capital alleged accounting issues at the company. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) could also be a short squeeze target in the future if Redditors band together and pile into this stock in the coming weeks.
A total of 19 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). The total value of these stakes was $57 million. The biggest stakeholder of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns an $11.7 million stake in the company.
Kerrisdale Capital made the following comment about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the investor letter:
“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.
This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23

(NYSE:AMC), which was once a darling of Reddit’s WSB bets and still remains one of the most popular stocks among retail investors, posted its Q4 results that crushed analyst estimates.

Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:
“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”

6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares have been on a roll since Bob Iger came back to the top seat. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is up about 12% year to date through April 17. Recently, BofA increased its estimates for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) for the second quarter and praised Bob Iger’s initiatives to turn the company around. BofA analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich likes Iger’s cost-cutting plans and his efforts to give control to creative execs, among other steps.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) ranks 6th in our list of the most popular retail investor stocks in 2023.
As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 99 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey have stakes in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).
VGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:
“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.
Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.
Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalise over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)

Filing for bankruptcy is often considered a last resort, and for good reason. It's often expensive and can ruin a person's credit score. Plus, it can make it harder to qualify for financing -- like credit cards or loans -- with decent rates and terms.

But like most things, there's a time and place for bankruptcy -- as you can see from some of the famous business titans who've filed at least once in their lives. In many of these cases, bankruptcy is nothing more than a strategic tool used to restructure debt and ensure future financial prosperity.
With that in mind, here are six famous business individuals who have filed for bankruptcy and how it turned out for them.

Dave Ramsey
The founder of Ramsey Solutions, Dave Ramsey is a well-known financial self-help guru in the personal finance space. But before all of that, Ramsey took on a lot of debt -- primarily real estate loans -- that he couldn't afford to pay back. As a result, he filed for bankruptcy -- he was in his late 20s at the time. It took Ramsey some time to build his way back to financial success. Today, his net worth is around $200 million, $150 million of which is in real estate.

Walt Disney
Walt Disney is famously known for his work in animation and innovation. He was also a visionary when it came to entrepreneurship. Today, he's perhaps best known for co-founding Walt Disney Productions, as well as Disneyland and Disney World.
But in 1921, two years before The Walt Disney Company came into being, Walt founded a film animation studio called Laugh-O-Gram Studio. This was Walt's first major attempt in the industry, and one that wasn't very successful. Just two years after founding the company, it went bankrupt. Soon after, Walt moved to Hollywood and began working on what would later become The Disney Company. In 2023, Disney had a net worth of approximately $108.87 billion.

Henry Ford
Both a businessman and a skilled machinist, Henry Ford started his career in building automobiles in the early 1890s. His innovation and skills earned him a reputation in the industry, and he gained the support of several investors. As a result, he founded the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899.
However, Ford only ever manufactured one vehicle at a time. This limited his ability to expand and caused dissatisfaction amongst the shareholders. By 1901 -- just 18 months after launch -- Detroit Automobile Company went bankrupt and was dissolved. That didn't stop Ford, though. He continued manufacturing cars and, through a combination of good connections and innovation, founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903. By the mid-1920s, Ford had an estimated net worth of about $1.2 billion.

Donald Trump
Donald Trump is, of course, the former president of the United States. But he's also a prominent businessman with a history of filing for bankruptcy. In fact, Trump has filed for business bankruptcy (Chapter 11) anywhere from four to six times over the years. He has never filed for personal bankruptcy.
Trump's first business bankruptcy case was for the Trump Taj Mahal, a casino he owned, in 1991. After that, he filed for bankruptcy for several other hotels, casinos, and entertainment resorts.
Despite having filed for bankruptcy several times, Trump was able to keep his assets secure while restructuring massive amounts of debt. Today, he has an estimated net worth of about $2.5 billion.

Larry King
A prominent talk show host in his later years, Larry King began his career as a radio announcer. In the beginning, he struggled financially due to a low salary and a series of unwise financial decisions.
At the age of 38, King allegedly used borrowed money rather than give the money to its intended recipient, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison. As a result, he was charged with grand larceny.
Although he wasn't prosecuted, the entire scandal ruined King's name and reputation. It also cost him his job as a radio host. By 1978, King owed $352,000 in various debts and had to file for bankruptcy.
King spent the following years rebuilding his reputation and making a name for himself in the industry. He got his own CNN television show -- ""Larry King Live"" -- in 1985. He continued on with this show for over 25 years. By the time of his death in 2021, he had an estimated net worth of $50 million.

Milton Hershey
Milton Hershey got his start in the late 1800s when he launched his own candy shop using a $100 loan from his aunt. Unfortunately for Hershey, his first several attempts at business resulted in bankruptcy.
It wasn't until he joined forces with Henry Lebkicher, a former employee, that he managed to raise enough money to launch the Lancaster Caramel Company. This company became rather successful, but Hershey ended up selling it to the American Caramel Company in 1900 for $1 million.
Hershey used the money to start mass-producing chocolate. He also built his first factory in Pennsylvania -- a factory that would later become the famous Hershey Company. In 1918, the company was worth about $60 million -- equivalent to over $1 billion today.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Ford Motor's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
The top 25 shareholders own 40% of the company
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
If you want to know who really controls Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 56% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Ford Motor, beginning with the chart below.
View our latest analysis for Ford Motor
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Ford Motor. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Ford Motor, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Ford Motor. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.6% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Ford Motor Company. Insiders own US$646m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
With a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ford Motor. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Ford Motor better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Ford Motor you should be aware of.

Ford posts $1.76B 1Q profit largely on gas-powered vehicles,02-May-23,DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. made $1.76 billion last quarter swinging  into ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-posts-1-76b-1q-203307421.html,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. made $1.76 billion last quarter, swinging into the black from a $3.1 billion net loss for the same period a year ago.
Most of the profit came from Ford Blue, the company's internal-combustion engine vehicle unit, which made $2.62 billion before taxes during the quarter. Ford Pro, the commercial vehicle unit, added $1.37 billion. But Model e, Ford's electric vehicle unit, lost $722 million before taxes.
The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is seeing its fortunes improve, and reiterated its earlier pretax profit guidance for the full year of $9 billion to $11 billion.
Excluding one-time items, Ford made 44 cents per share. That beat Wall Street estimates of 42 cents, according to FactSet.
Revenue rose 20% to $41.74 billion, soundly beating the $39.25 billion that analysts expected.
Previously Ford said it left $2 billion in profits on the table last year due to production losses from computer chip and parts shortages and high operational costs.
“This quarter was much smoother,” Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters Tuesday. “We've done a lot of work on improving the rate and flow of semiconductors, production stability, working through potential other issues with the supply base outside of chips.”
Lawler said the results showed in the revenue increase, and that the company would continue to work on improvements that will boost the bottom line.
Ford's profits were fueled largely by sales in the U.S., its most lucrative market. Ford sold just under 472,000 vehicles from January through March, up 9.9% from the previous year.
The company continued to get strong prices for its vehicles during the quarter, driven by loaded out trucks and big SUVs. Ford’s average sale price was $56,534, according to Edmunds.
Lawler predicted that as production gets back to normal and vehicle supplies increase, automakers will start to offer discounts. He predicted that Ford's prices would remain flat while the industry would be down about 5% for the year.
Earlier Tuesday, Ford cut prices on its Mustang Mach E electric SUV, the same day Tesla raised prices slightly on the Model Y, the Mach E's main competitor.
Ford also said it is reopening the order bank on Wednesday for the Mach E after upgrading a factory in Mexico to increase output.
Lawler said the company lowered prices because it wants to stay competitive in the crowded small electric SUV segment of the market and attract new buyers. Over 60% of Mach E customers are new to Ford, he said.
“EV customers up front aren't loyal, but once they do purchase, they're loyal to that brand,"" he said. ""So we expect to have these customers across their whole lifetimes.”
But CEO Jim Farley said the company is going after a profitable electric vehicle business. “We are not going to price just to gain market share,” he told analysts.
Ford says its first-generation electric vehicles will be profitable on a pretax basis by the end of 2024. Farley said that by the end of the year, Ford will have reduced costs on the Mach E by $5,000 per vehicle.
The first-quarter loss last year was due mainly to a drop in valuation of Ford’s investment in electric vehicle startup Rivian, which saw its stock slide.
Ford shares closed Tuesday down 2.2%, and they dropped another 2% in extended trading after the earnings were announced.","{'negative': 0.930665502945582, 'neutral': 0.7785743985857282, 'positive': 0.8208263867041644}",0.7785743985857282,0.8208263867041644,0.930665502945582

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-sees-1-5-billion-112039671.html,"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co expects to take up restructuring charges between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in 2023, it said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, as part of the U.S. automaker's move to exit unprofitable locations and cut headcount.
The charges will be primarily attributable to ""employee separations and supplier settlements,"" the automaker said, adding additional restructuring actions may be taken ""where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible when considering the capital allocation required for those businesses.""
Earlier this year, Ford said it plans to cut one in nine jobs in Europe, as part of a drive to lower costs in the region and concentrate engineering know-how in the United States.
It has also been curbing operations in countries such as Brazil and India, as it pours billions into developing electric vehicles.
The disclosure comes a day after the company posted robust quarterly results but issued a measured full-year outlook, weighed down by continued losses in its electric-vehicle unit.

Ford cuts prices of Mustang Mach-E after Tesla moves,02-May-23,WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cuts-prices-mustang-mach-141412882.html,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle and reopening orders, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said on Tuesday, the second time has reduced prices this year after a series of price cuts by rival Tesla Inc.
Ford said it is also increasing the range for standard-range battery models as it increases production of the electric crossover SUV in the second half of the year.
Prices for most Mach-E models were cut by $3,000 or $4,000 depending on the version or by as much as 7.8%, Ford said. The price of the Mach-E Premium rear-wheel drive version is dropping from $50,995 to $46,995.
Ford CEO Jim Farley told analysts Ford does not intend to pursue EV sales volume ""at any cost.... ""We are not going to price just to gain market share.""
Farley's stance contrasts with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statement last month that Tesla could cut profit margins on vehicle sales to zero and make up the difference through sales of software-enabled services.
Ford shares closed down 2.2% at $11.80 Tuesday and fell 1.5% in after-hours trading after it reported first quarter earnings.
Last month, the federal EV tax credit for the Mach-E fell by half to $3,750 from $7,500 after new battery sourcing requirements took effect.
Mustang Mach-E U.S. sales fell 20% in the first three months of the year. Ford said Tuesday shipments of the Mustang Mach-E were limited in the first three months of the year to make industrial changes that will nearly double manufacturing capacity.
In January, Ford cut prices of the Mustang Mach-E by as much as $5,900 per vehicle after hiking prices in August by $3,000 to around $8,000, citing supply-chain issues and higher material costs.
Ford said all standard-range models will now be powered by lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which allows vehicles to gain an additional 45 units of horsepower and improves the targeted EPA range estimates.
On Monday, Tesla raised prices in a range of up to $290 in Canada, China, Japan and the United States after the company had slashed prices on its top-selling vehicles since the start of the year.
The hike was Tesla's first on its two top-selling models at the same time in multiple markets, although prices across its lineup are much lower than in January, after a round of discounts.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 0.7% at the market close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid more than 200 points, or 0.8%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.46%.
In addition to raising the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, the Fed left its options open for June, saying future rate hikes would be dependent on the impact of previous rate hikes on the economy.
In Wednesday's statement, the Fed said, ""in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic an financial developments.""
In March, the central bank had said it ""anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.""
At a press conference following the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the change to the statement ""meaningful,"" noting that ""we’ll be driven by incoming data.""
Stocks ticked up on the initial news but lost steam when Powell commented on the prospect of cutting rates.
“We on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly,” Powell said, adding that “if that forecast is broadly right, it will not be appropriate to cut rates.”

Prior to the Fed decision, analysts had said inflation remains sticky, the labor market is still hot but softening, and the economy is resilient. Plus, recent bank failures could set up the case for a pause in June, along with the Treasury Department's new projections adding more caution to the mix as lawmakers may have less than a month to reach a debt-ceiling deal.
On Wednesday, government bonds fell sharply. The yield on the 10-year note dipped down to 3.35% while the two-year note yield slipped to 3.85%. Oil prices tumbled — futures for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, dropped more than 4% to $68.22 a barrel.
Separately, hiring at private companies unexpectedly rose by 296,000 for April, above economists call for 148,000, according to payroll processing firm ADP. Other data out on Wednesday showed that ISM services PMI increased to 51.9 in April from 51.2 in March and slightly above economists estimates of 51.8.
Here are some of the trending tickers on Yahoo Finance:
Ford Motor Company (F): The carmaker’s EV unit registered a $722 million quarterly loss. The automaker is nonetheless slashing the price of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E.
CVS Health Corporation (CVS): The company posted a rise in sales during its first quarter as it closed its $10.6 billion deal for Oak Street Health’s 600 primary-care centers.
Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The pharmaceutical company announced positive results on its drug donanemab, which had significantly slowed the progression of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms.
Starbucks Corporation (SBUX): The coffee giant posted second-quarter earnings and sales expectations and notched comparable-store sales growth in China.
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (IEP): Billionaire Carl Icahn got the Hindenburg Research treatment. The short-selling research firm deemed the activist investor’s fund to be inflated by 75% or more.
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL): The beauty brand forecasted a bigger drop in full-year sales and profit on Wednesday, hurt by a slowdown in China and reduced inventory levels by retailers in the U.S.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The chipmaker reported a drop in margins and provided a forecast that didn’t give much indication for improvement.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leslie-doggett-industries-acquires-4-150600349.html,"HOUSTON, May 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Houston based Leslie Doggett Industries (""Doggett"") acquired 4 Kinsel Auto dealerships in Beaumont, Texas effective Monday, May 1, 2023. Doggett through their Auto Group Division has acquired Kinsel's Toyota, Ford, Lincoln, and Mazda dealerships (owned and managed by Beaumont's legendary car dealer, Joe Bob Kinsel) on Beaumont's Eastex Freeway 96 in the heart of Beaumont's metro area. Doggett has been a Ford dealer for 4 years in Houston acquiring Landmark Ford on the North Freeway in 2018. Since that acquisition, Doggett has received the Ford Motor Company's highest performing and highest customer satisfaction award, The Ford President's Award two years in a row and has been recognized as the fastest growing Ford store in the United States. With that performance, Doggett and The Ford Motor Company have been eager for Doggett to add more Ford dealerships to the Doggett Group of companies. Doggett has been a Toyota Industrial dealer since 1993, winning their coveted President's Award more than fifteen times.
Doggett through their Auto Group Division has acquired Kinsel’s Toyota, Ford, Lincoln, and Mazda dealerships.
William Doggett, COO and President of Doggett Industries, commented on his families experience as a Ford Dealer and his thoughts going forward ""Doggett is a huge believer in the future of Ford given the current Ford strategy on three fronts: First, Ford's determination to push-forward with their market leading gas, diesel and hybrid models investing heavily in IC vehicles and believing in the future of IC vehicles; second, their robust Electric vehicle roll-out which will be second-to-none including the F150 Lightning, SUVs and the E-Mustang and third and finally, Ford's exciting work truck line-up which has maintained its number 1 market share position for decades. No other manufacturer comes close to this exciting 3-legged strategy, in my opinion. With Toyota, we have been partners for more than 30 years and we are extremely excited to be an auto dealer for them. Toyota being the number 1 most reliable vehicle sold, the number 1 market share brand sold and their leading technology with hybrids is a winning combination for Toyota, Doggett, and our customers. We are anxious to give Toyota automotive customers the same great service we've provided industrial customers over the past 30 years.""
Brian McLemore, CEO of Doggett, says that ""Doggett has found that the Ford Motor Company and Doggett are very similar enterprises given the family culture deeply embedded in both. That's somewhat unusual in enterprises our size"". McLemore continues, ""Doggett is one of Houston's largest family-owned businesses measured by sales volume all achieved by putting the customer first and living the motto that Uptime is Everything for our Customers and technicians are the lifeblood of our business.""
Jason Mosley, Vice President and GM of the Doggett Automotive Group says ""Doggett is the John Deere Construction Equipment dealer and the Toyota Material Handling dealer for Beaumont (east Texas) and we are confident these five businesses will complement each other providing customers a single world-class supplier for their auto, construction equipment and forklift needs. Doggett expects these Ford, Lincoln and Mazda stores to add over $200 million in sales volume to Doggett's growing enterprise within 18 months all driven by Doggett's customer First Approach providing a wonderful truly different customer experience"".

EV Players Are Speeding and Ramping Up Despite an ...,04-May-23,... Ford's EV investment in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN).  ADVERTISEMENT ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-players-speeding-ramping-despite-152148411.html,"On May 2nd, the legendary automaker Ford Motor (NYSE: F) reported stellar first quarter results as it ramps up EV production, a week after its Detroit peer General Motors (NYSE: GM) did the same while also raising its 2023 guidance. Today, a disruptive EV player whose revolutionary tonneau covers will be equipping pickup trucks from nine automotive manufacturers, Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP)(NASDAQ: WKSPW), revealed its $4 million custom European manufacturing line has been installed at its NY facility, making the company a step closer to focusing on revenue growth.
Worksport Enters The Training And Testing Phase
After receiving the manufacturing line earlier than expected in March, Worksport has now completed the installation of the equipment and is, therefore, able to begin training its staff. The training phase should take several weeks and it will be followed by numerous test runs. Worksport also began building the assembly line at its 220,000 square feet West Seneca, New York factory.
What's In Store?
When production begins, Worksport's hard-folding tonneau covers are expected to reach the market right away. Worksport will be providing an update on its newly redesigned portable COR HD advanced hot-swap battery system, which must be tested and completed before the solar-powered SOLIS cover becomes available for sale.
Ford Reports A Stellar Quarter
Despite growing losses on the EV front, fleet and legacy operations have enabled Ford to top Wall Street estimates for its first quarter results. CFO described the reported quarter as being a “peek at what’s possible to generate value and growth”, only months after CEO Jim Farley admitted that last year, execution issues disabled Ford from capitalizing on $2 billion it made in additional profits. This time, Farley reported that Ford is making real progress on its Ford+ growth plan.
Ford’s First Quarter Figures
With automotive revenue of $39.09 billion topping the $36.08 billion Refinitiv expected, total revenue, which includes the impact of Ford Credit, grew 20% YoY as it amounted to $41.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share amounted to 63 cents and topped Refinitiv’s estimate of 41 cents. Net income amounted to $1.8 billion or 44 cents per share. Although it is a dramatic difference from 2022’s comparable quarter when Ford made a net loss of $3.1 billion, or 78 cents per share, this figure was dragged down by a one-off charge related to Ford's EV investment in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN).
Ramping up EV production came with widening operational losses as they increased from 2022 quarter’s $380 million to $722 million. Ford washed off its EV losses with its traditional automotive business named Ford Blue that earned $2.6 billion as well as Ford Pro fleet operations that earned $1.4 billion. Moreover, management stated that both businesses were profitable in every single region where they operate. This is the first time Ford is reporting results of its individual business segments.
Ford Reiterated Its Full Year Guidance
Unlike General Motors who raised its full year guidance, Ford still expects full-year adjusted earnings to be in the range between $9 billion and $11 billion despite the significant beat. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range between $8 billion and $9 billion, with EV operations named as “Model e” expected to result in losses of about $3 billion. Model e is expected to reach a positive EBIT margin of 8% by the end of 2026. But despite results and raised guidance, General Motors’ shares still fell as investors showed concern due to the unstable environment and price war that was initiated by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Efforts To Catch Up To Tesla
Earlier on Tuesday, Ford revealed that it will once more be slashing the starting prices of its EV, Mustang Mach-E, expecting on average $5,000 in build-cost reductions. These discounts will be aided by switching from lithium ion to lithium-iron phosphate batteries but Ford still needs to decide what will its EV identity be: growing fast at a cost like Tesla or prioritizing a cost discipline approach. Last month, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, confirmed that it will be putting growth ahead of profits in this weakened macroeconomic climate. However, Tesla’s strategy also implies that its vehicles are expected to generate significant profit over the long haul due to autonomy. Even Tesla’s investors and supporters got worried after the latest quarterly report with Musk showing willingness to further sacrifice margins in exchange for market share, with some wondering is it truly a move to disrupt or one of desperation, but Musk assured that the aggressive price cuts are merely a short-term strategy while Tesla’s long-term margins remain protected.
Moving Forward Despite All Challenges
With the EV price war having kicked off into high gear and the macroeconomic fears of an upcoming recession beginning to materialize, investors will be up for many more nights, but Ford and General Motors continue going full speed ahead with Worksport getting the industry another step closer to an electric and greener future of transportation.

Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant road-tests a new quality strategy,01-May-23,Ford spent $4.17 billion on warranty claims last year more than larger  rival General Motors Co. ... Yahoo Finance. All 737-Max 9 jets to remain  grounded until...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fords-kentucky-truck-plant-road-110328821.html,"By Joseph White
LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - Shutting down the assembly lines that build Super Duty pickup trucks at Ford Motor Co's Kentucky Truck Plant is a multimillion-dollar action company managers try hard to avoid.
As part of a new approach to stamping out quality demons, Kentucky Truck Plant manager Joseph Closurdo said he stopped production for as long as three days earlier this year. The halts gave engineers and suppliers time to fix defective parts discovered as workers began building a new generation of Ford's highly profitable heavy-duty pickups.
""We would shut the build down if we weren't meeting one of the targets"" for quality, Closurdo said on the plant floor last week.
Halting the assembly line rather than building trucks and fixing them later was just one element of a new approach to attacking quality problems that Ford is road-testing with the launch of the redesigned Super Duty trucks.
Ford's Super Duty model line has been around since 1998. A successful launch for the latest generation is critical for Ford to hit profit targets for this year. The automaker will report first-quarter results on Tuesday afternoon after the close of New York stock market trading.
The Super Duty trucks, heavy-duty pickups designed to tow large trailers or handle rugged commercial tasks, now come in luxury versions that can sell for more than $100,000. The Super Duties are among the most profitable vehicles Ford sells, generating billions in annual profit, analysts estimate.
Slashing the tax that quality problems levy on Ford's profitability has become Job One for Chief Executive Jim Farley. Ford spent $4.17 billion on warranty claims last year, more than larger rival General Motors Co. A successful launch for the Super Duty line is critical for Ford to hit its profit targets for this year.
Ford executives bet that investing more to catch quality problems early will pay off in the long run.
""We set the standard to be better than the outgoing product. We did not start shipping until we saw consistent delivery on those targets,"" Super Duty Chief Engineer Andrew Kernahan told Reuters. ""It took us longer than was planned.""
TOUCHING EVERY BUTTON
Kentucky Truck added 300 quality inspectors, and more engineers to chase down the root causes of defects and design new digital tools for catching problems before trucks rolled off the end of the line.
Workers now use a camera to feed images of electrical connections to software that can determine whether the connectors are properly connected.
Around the plant, engineers built command centers with more big screens than many sports bars, all displaying data from different assembly stations. One command center, with 16 screens, is known as Claire's Corner because it was designed by process engineering manager Claire Yarmak.
""The complexity of this vehicle is huge,"" Yarmak said. New comfort features, such as a front seat that reclines to create a sleeping bed, create new opportunities for trouble. When a sensor hooked into Yarmak's screens detected a defective sensor in the sleeper seat, the line stopped.
Instead of test-driving a small sample of trucks to check for squeaks, rattles or infotainment system glitches - problems that take down scores on external quality surveys - Kentucky Truck deployed workers to drive 28,000 of the first new-generation Super Duties along a 25-mile (40 km) route near the factory.
""If it's got a button, touch it. Make sure it works,"" said David Jones, a member of the test-driving team and a 34-year Ford veteran whose father also worked at Kentucky Truck.
Instead of building all the different versions of the Super Duty from the start, Kentucky Truck started with the simplest work trucks and worked up to models such as Tremor diesel that has more electronic features and luxury appointments and a price tag as high as $119,000.
Even more expensive King Ranch and Platinum Super Duty models are just going into production now, Closurdo said.
Kentucky Truck's dual assembly lines are now running at close to full speed, cranking out a new Super Duty, as well as Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs, at a pace of roughly one a minute.
Lessons learned from the Super Duty launch process are being relayed to factories that will launch the next new Ford vehicles, including a redesigned Mustang, Closurdo said.
""It's the benchmark,"" he said.

Ford Motor's estimated fair value is US$18.31 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Ford Motor is estimated to be 35% undervalued based on current share price of US$11.89
Our fair value estimate is 32% higher than Ford Motor's analyst price target of US$13.86
In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
The Calculation
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 14%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$123b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$123b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$33b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$73b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$11.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
dcf
The Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Ford Motor
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.
Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.
Looking Ahead:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Ford Motor, there are three important factors you should further research:
Risks: You should be aware of the 4 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 is potentially serious!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.
Future Earnings: How does F's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market? Dig deeper into the analyst consensus number for the upcoming years by interacting with our free analyst growth expectation chart.

Ford Motor Company (F) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know ...,09-May-23,For the current quarter Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of  $0.45 per share indicating a change of -33.8% from the year-ago quarter.  The Zacks...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-trending-130001596.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 17.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating a change of -33.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 points to a change of -13.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +8.2%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.63 indicates a change of +0.6% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.9%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $155.6 billion and $156.3 billion estimates indicate +4.4% and +0.5% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $39.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.7%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.38 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +57.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-hires-former-apple-executive-134727312.html,"(Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday named former Apple Inc executive Mike Abbott to lead a division that will bring together three software functions within the company.
Abbott, whose appointment is effective from May 22, will spearhead development of vehicle and enterprise software technologies.
Automakers, including GM and Ford Motor Co, have been increasingly ramping up their investment on technology and software services amid an electric-vehicle push, as they look to cash in on subscription-based services.
""We have entered the next phase of our technology driven transformation focused on rapidly scaling new EV models,"" GM's CEO Mary Barra said.
At Apple, Abbott led a team responsible for the development of core infrastructure for all of the company's cloud-based services including iCloud, iMessage, Private Relay, Mail and account security.
Bloomberg News had in March reported Abbott would step down from his role at the iPhone maker. He previously held top roles at Twitter and Palm, and was a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.
GM's announcement comes nearly two years after Detroit-based peer Ford appointed the head of Apple's car project, Doug Field, to lead its advanced technology and embedded systems efforts.

With car prices on the rise, it's tempting to buy the cheapest car you can find. But when it comes to cars, the saying ""you get what you pay for"" can really ring true.
New Car Market: Prices Are About To Plummet Due To Oversupply
Find Out: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch
GOBankingRates spoke to car experts about the economy cars that are not worth their (relatively) low sticker prices due to poor driving experiences, limited cargo space or frequent mechanical issues. Here are the cheap cars you may regret buying.

Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross
Joe Giranda, managing member at CFR Classic, which specializes in international car shipping and relocation, said you can get better cars for the price of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross.
""Both the 2022 and 2023 models of Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross don't really make the cut when it comes to value for money,"" he said. ""The 2023 Eclipse Cross actually transitioned to a standard AWD powertrain, which means driving in wet or icy conditions will prove to be difficult. It is also quite outdated, with limited tech features and a lack of cabin space compared to its competitors. Back-road road manners leave a lot to be desired as well, with harsh ride quality and noticeable body roll in tight corners.""

Subaru WRX
Although the Subura WRX is marketed as a sports vehicle, Giranda said that it doesn't live up to the category.
""It's criticized for being underpowered, as its 2.4-liter turbocharged engine is relatively weak when compared to those in other comparable models,"" he said. ""Fuel economy is also below average at only 22 mpg combined city/highway, a figure that's actually worse off than its predecessor. When it comes to the trunk, the WRX is also dwarfed by its rivals, with a tiny 12.5 cubic feet of storage space, making it difficult to fit large items inside. Even the inside of the cabin is quite cramped for adult passengers.""

Hyundai Veloster
Ray Pierce, CEO and founder of Zippy Cash for Cars, a car-buying company, said that the Veloster is prone to issues.
""Owners of the Hyundai Veloster have complained about a range of problems with their vehicles,"" he said. ""Failure of the connecting rod, power loss, and electrical and mechanical faults are a few of the most frequent concerns. The engine has stalled and lost power for certain drivers, among other problems.""
It also has a small cargo space, Pierce added.

Fiat 500L
Nick Musica, founder of Cash for Your Junk Car, a business that offers a way for customers to sell their used cars, said that there are a number of reasons why you should avoid buying the Fiat 500L.
""Due to its propensity for mechanical issues, poor reliability and high depreciation rate, the Fiat 500L is generally regarded as a bad choice,"" he said. ""The gearbox, electrical system and engine have all been known to have problems, which can result in expensive repairs. Additionally, the lack of refinement and poor build quality make for a less-than-pleasant driving experience. The car's resale value also plummets rapidly, making it a poor investment for those planning to sell it in the future.""
XYP Photography / Ford
Ford Fiesta
Robert Walden, a car mechanic and the founder of VehicleFreak.com, said to avoid the Fiesta due to its faulty transmission.
""While it's true that this little hatchback has an attractive price tag and decent fuel efficiency, it's infamous for its problematic transmission,"" he said. ""A few years back, I had a client who came in with a Fiesta and the transmission was slipping, causing jerky acceleration. I remember how frustrated they were because it wasn't their first time dealing with this issue. And believe me, it wasn't cheap to fix!""

Chevrolet Aveo
Luis Johnson, automobile technician and founder of BatteryQuery, warns that Aveo owners typically spend a lot of time (and money) at the mechanic.
""While the Aveo may seem like a great deal due to its low price tag, it is notorious for its poor build quality and frequent mechanical issues,"" he said. ""In the long run, buyers may end up spending more on repairs than they saved on the initial purchase price.""
©Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
Dodge Dart
Johnson also cautioned against purchasing the Dodge Dart.
""The Dodge Dart was marketed as a sporty and affordable compact car, but it fell short in terms of reliability and durability,"" he said. ""It is known for its transmission issues and frequent recalls, making it a car that buyers may regret.""

""The Nissan Versa may be one of the most affordable cars on the market, but it is also one of the least reliable,"" Johnson said. ""It is known for its transmission issues and frequent need for repairs.""

Chevrolet Trax
Nick Rivadeneira, a car enthusiast and the founder of Racebuilds, a peer-to-peer marketplace for car parts, said to stay away from the Trax, particularly the 2017 model year.
""Although it has its advantages, such as agility and efficiency, some major drawbacks may make you regret your purchase,"" he said. ""The biggest issue is frequent repairs, which can be costly and inconvenient.
""While the 1.4-liter turbocharged is super efficient, it's not so powerful, making the ride quality and acceleration somewhat lackluster,"" Rivadeneira continued. ""And cargo space is limited -- you'll have to get creative with the trunk if you plan to bring more than a couple of suitcases. Finally, the Trax is not great at retaining its value. While most vehicles certainly depreciate over time, this one experiences a sharp decrease as soon as it hits the secondhand market.""
©Nissan
Nissan Sentra
The newer Nissan Sentra models are not worth your money, said Adam Grant, a car specialist and founder of Car Fuel Advisor.
""Nissan Sentra went through a redesign in 2020, and this redesign brought significant design improvement and performance enhancement. However, this car's 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is still reported to be loud and lack power, which results in sluggish acceleration,"" he said. ""On top of that, this car's infotainment system is a bit outdated and lacks some modern features that many competitors in the same class have.""
©Toyota
Toyota Yaris
Grant said that the Yaris lacks the power and performance that many drivers desire.
""Toyota redesigned this subcompact car in 2020 and ensured good fuel economy, better comfort and an elegant interior. However, the power and acceleration of this car are not that satisfactory,"" he said. ""Also, the Yaris is available as a sedan only with no hatchback option, which is a considerable drawback for some buyers. Overall, this model would not be a smart choice for someone who prioritizes power and performance.""

25 Smallest Countries In the World That Matter the Most,10-May-23,However despite their best efforts America's largest conventional car  manufacturers namely General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor  Company (NYSE:F)...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-smallest-countries-world-matter-064619121.html,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 smallest countries in the world that matter the most. For more countries, head on over to 5 Smallest Countries in the World That Matter the Most.
In modern day geopolitics where everything boils down to resources, economic and military power, geographic size usually does not matter when it comes to international politics and influence. Take for instance the example of Africa. Africa is the world's second largest continent in terms of both its population and its area. However, Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) is a mere $2.96 trillion in nominal terms. Compare this GDP with that of New York City - the world's largest city in terms of economic output. New York's GMP (gross metropolitan product) sits at $2.01 trillion - more than two thirds of the entire African economy. In fact, New York's most prosperous district, Manhattan, had a GDP of $651 billion in 2020 - greater than the $376 billion GDP of Pakistan, the world's fifth most populous country according to data from the United Nations.
So, as is clear from New York's example, size really doesn't matter in a lot of cases. Another example of this phenomenon comes from the corporate world. In terms of employees, one of the world's largest companies is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart has a whopping 2.1 million employees working for it, and it earned $11.6 billion in profits during its fiscal year that ended in June 2023. However, one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has a mere 164,000 employees working for it - less than one tenth of Walmart's workforce. Yet, despite this, Apple's profit during its fiscal year ending in September 2022 was $99 billion - almost nine times that of Walmart's. Of course, the different nature of the duo's business model requires Walmart to have more employees. It is after all primarily a retailer which needs more employees to run its stores. Yet, as is evident, a higher number of employees does not translate into higher profit gains for shareholders as these depend more on the product category and technology involved.
On the flip side, being larger comes to Walmart's benefit when we consider its total revenues. The firm earned $611 billion in revenue during its latest fiscal year, more than $200 billion higher than Apple's latest fiscal year revenue of $394 billion.
In the financial world too, size is a key factor. For instance, one of the largest investment holding companies in the world is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Berkshire does not operate in a way that a hedge fund does, i.e. the firm does not seek to rapidly trade shares to make a profit. Instead, it takes up stakes in firms that it believes will do well in the future and makes money from investments in sectors such as manufacturing and energy as well as through dividends. The firm had a whopping $948 billion in assets as of 2022 end, and its size ensures that when it buys shares, the entire market moves.
As an example, Berkshire disclosed in mid November 2022 that it had bought a $4.1 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) - the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. Prior to the announcement, TSMC's shares had taken a beating on the stock market, and the American Depository Receipts (ADRs) had dropped to $60 at the start of November. However, as soon as word broke of Berkshire's investment, the ADRs jumped from $74 on November 11 to $80.5 the day after the investment firm's SEC filings revealed the purchase. Currently, they are trading at $84.30, still higher than the November low and despite the fact that Mr. Buffett has since sold the shares as he is worried about the geopolitical risk in Taiwan and TSMC's inability to control it.
Finally, while heft might sound comforting in times of trouble, it still ends up constraining one's ability to be agile. The clearest example of this phenomenon in the business world is the rise of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla is the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and leads the market due to new manufacturing processes that it has developed on its own. However, despite their best efforts, America's largest conventional car manufacturers, namely General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), have yet to match Tesla's success in the market despite bringing in as much as three times in revenue as the firm.
With these details in mind, let's take a look at some smallest countries in the world that matter the most.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ford Motor's current trading price of US$11.64 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What's The Opportunity In Ford Motor?
Great news for investors – Ford Motor is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $18.23, but it is currently trading at US$11.64 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Ford Motor’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Ford Motor. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? Since F is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on F for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy F. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.
So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Ford Motor at this point in time. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Ford Motor you should be mindful of and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.

Why Ford is eyeing cost cuts in China,16-May-23,Joy Falotico Group Vice President Lincoln Motor Company and Chief  Marketing Officer and Jim Farley President Global Markets Ford Motor  Company pose...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ford-is-eyeing-cost-cuts-in-china-152807176.html,"With greater transparency for investors at Ford (F) comes the need for a tighter grip on costs.
Local reports out of China on Monday suggested the auto manufacturer was preparing to cut 1,300 jobs in the country.
Ford CEO Jim Farley quickly dialed back concerns that the company was leaving the ultra-competitive China market entirely, speaking in a Financial Times interview. It operates eight manufacturing plants in partnership with local Chinese players.
A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that Ford has no plans to exit China. The automaker will remain focused on its luxury brand Lincoln, which has long been ""popular"" in the country, the source said.
It will also put more attention on delivery vans in China, the person said.

Ford does not recognize the job-cut figure reported by media, a company spokesperson told Yahoo! Finance via email.
""We will continue to accelerate our electrification transformation in China. Our new localized EV products are under development now. We are also working with our partners to strengthen our EV business, including expanding the distribution. Our China team will contribute more to Ford’s global success through our learnings from the market and capabilities in electrification and digital software,"" the spokesperson said.
""In addition, we will build on the strength of our export business and have just reached an agreement with JMC to export more products to global markets, particularly in Asia, Middle East and South America.""
But in the FT interview, Farley did acknowledge that Ford would be putting ""less capital at risk"" in China.
""We are aware that our costs are not competitive, and we are working internally and with our partners to reduce costs in all areas,"" the spokesperson said. ""China remains a very important market for Ford and, as part of this, we must drive a lean and agile organization to build a healthier and more sustainable business in China.""
The comments echo Farley's more cautious tone on China, heard on the company's early May earnings call a few weeks after a recent leadership trip to the country.
Ford's increasingly focused approach to China makes sense.
For starters, it has seen its business dwindle in the country over the years.
The auto manufacturer sold 500,000 retail units in China in 2022, down from 600,000 in 2020, according to the company's latest annual report. Ford's market share during that timeframe fell to 2.1% from 2.4%.
By comparison, Ford had a 28.3% combined market share position in the US and Canada in 2022.
In the meantime, Ford is smack in the middle of what it has dubbed a ""refounding"" of the company as it gears up for a future of EVs. It has broken its business into three new segments for investors: Model E, Ford Blue (gas-powered vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial vehicles and other services).
The reclassifications aim to drive increased transparency into Ford's business for investors. But it could also lead to increased investor scrutiny of various investments and the direction of profits.
Pulling back on a China market that isn't delivering home-run results could aid in improving profits and shifting assets to EV production in the US.
""Our cost structure is not competitive,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on Yahoo! Finance Live in late March. ""We know that we [have] about $7 billion to $8 billion that we could take out and improve our competitiveness, and you will see that start to take hold as we get through the rest of the year, into 2024, and beyond.""
Better cost management — especially in international operations like China — is key to the thesis among Ford bulls on Wall Street.
""We find Ford shares attractive given valuation only roughly in line with history despite a number of significant positives, including (1) a substantially refreshed vehicle lineup including hot new introductions such as the Mustang Mach-E battery electric crossover, new Ford Bronco (>190K reservations), Bronco Sport, and upcoming F-150); (2) a refreshed F-150 has historically led to a substantial improvement in North American profitability; (3) the 'Bold Moves' Ford is taking to right-size its international operations, including most recently in South America, we think will free up capital for use in initiatives investors are likely to reward more, such as its electrification and autonomous efforts; and (4) Ford has been having recent success turning around its International Operations, including in China, which was previously a problem area,"" JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electric-vehicles-draining-billions-profitable-162715164.html,"There's nothing cheap about developing, manufacturing, delivering and investing in the future of electric vehicles (EVs). Ford Motor Co. is finding this out the hard way — just the same as many other automakers — with the company's EV unit projected to lose about $3 billion in 2023.

Is It A Big Deal?
A lot can be said for Ford's honesty with the public, its investors and potential EV buyers. Rather than hide from or sugarcoat the truth, the automobile giant has been straightforward about its investment in electric vehicles and the impact on its bottom line.
Losing $3 billion — even for a company Ford's size — is always a big deal. But Ford and its investors can take solace in the fact that the company still expects to generate a profit of between $9 billion and $11 billion this year.
It's much easier to lose $3 billion in the EV niche when the company as a whole is making up for it with more than three times the profits. The company also has its sights set on an 8% profit margin for the division by the end of 2026.

Why Is Ford Struggling In The EV Space?
Earlier this year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said during an earnings call that the company underestimated the expenses associated with boosting the production of electric vehicles.
""We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier and that that's [an extra] $300 a battery,"" he said. ""We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size.""
These sound like oversights, but they're actually growing pains. The electric vehicle market is still in its infancy. Automakers are constantly tweaking processes. Consumers are comparing their options and deciding whether it makes sense to buy now or wait until more of the kinks are worked out.
Other Problems The EV Market Must Solve
In addition to the above, other serious problems are standing in the way of the mass adoption of electric vehicles:
Inadequate charging infrastructure: It's improving throughout the country but is far from where it needs to be to handle an ever-growing number of electric vehicles.
EV fueling costs: All-encompassing, the cost of fueling an electric vehicle is often higher than a gasoline-powered vehicle. This is a deterrent to consumers who are on the fence.
EV prices remain high: Until prices are on par with their gasoline-powered counterparts, electric vehicles will be considered a luxury purchase by most.
As leading automakers like Ford, General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. continue to spend big money — and take big losses — on electric vehicles, several startups are making noise at the bottom of the market.

High-Risk, High Reward
It's clear that there's some serious upside associated with the risks involved. From general goodwill associated with their brands to the billions to be made in the current and future EV models. Lucid Group Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. are still sitting at premiums compared the ICE market, with many still bullish on the companies. Hence why these legacy automakers are willing to take these risks and invest in these technologies.
One of the biggest indicators, however, comes from the people investing in and, more importantly, buying these cars. Tesla Inc. began its climb to its astronomical heights when retail investors flocked to short-squeeze the stock, ultimately giving Tesla the billions it needed to thrive.
Retail investors have been pouring millions into these companies as they look to fund a greener future. This includes in the pre-IPO startups market as well. For example, Civilized Cycles launched on Wefunder, which means anyone can invest for a limited time, to fund its electric micro-mobility solution. The startup has continued to see substantial traction among retail investors.

Chicago, IL – May 16, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are Cardinal Health CAH, Boyd Gaming BYD, Ford Motor F, NXP Semiconductors N.V NXPI and American International AIG.
5 Attractive Value Picks Based on Discounted PEG
In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&P 500 Index during the same period.
Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Cardinal Health, Boyd Gaming, Ford Motor, NXP Semiconductors N.V and American International.
More on Value Investing
While searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).
This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.
However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to ""value traps"" — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.
In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.
The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate
A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.
While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.
There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.
Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.
Here are the five out of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening:
Cardinal Health: Headquartered in Dublin, OH, Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. The company has two reporting segments – Pharmaceutical and Medical.
Cardinal Health has a long-term expected growth rate of 12.4%. Cardinal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Boyd Gaming: Headquartered in Las Vegas, Boyd Gaming is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company. It owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania
Boyd Gaming currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. Boyd Gaming also has an impressive five-year historical growth rate of 40%.
Ford Motor: Dearborn, MI-based Ford Motor Company designs, manufactures, markets and services cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles. Apart from vehicles, the company provides financial services through Ford Motor Credit Company LLC. It employs approximately 199,000 employees worldwide.
Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Ford Motor currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Ford Motor has a long-term historical growth rate of 6.2%.
NXP Semiconductors: It provides high-performance mixed signal and standard product solutions that leverage its RF, analog, power management, interface, security, as well as digital processing expertise. These solutions are used in a wide range of applications, namely automotive, wireless infrastructure, lighting, industrial, mobile, consumer and computing.
NXP Semiconductors has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 22%. NXPI stock currently has a Value Score of B and a Zacks Rank of 2.
American International: It is a leading global insurance organization. Building on its long history, AIG provides a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services to customers in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions.
American International currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. It also has an impressive five-year historical growth rate of 13.6%.

Ford recalls 422000 SUVs because rear view camera display ...,18-May-23,WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is recalling 422000 sport utility ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-recalls-422-000-suvs-112916697.html,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is recalling 422,000 sport utility vehicles in the United States because the video output may fail even after getting a prior recall repair, preventing the rear view camera image from displaying.
The new recall covers 2020 through 2023 Ford Explorer, Lincoln Aviator, and 2020-2022 Lincoln Corsair SUVs with a 360-degree camera.
The recall expands and replaces prior Ford callbacks for the same issue in 2021 and 2023. Ford last year updated the image processing module (IPMB) software in an effort to address the issue.
Ford said on Thursday it is ""working together with suppliers to identify root cause and provide the correct remedy as quickly as possible"".
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the loss of the rear view camera image can reduce the driver's rear visibility, increasing the risk of a crash.
Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on June 26.
Last year, Ford said it had reports of 17 minor crashes relating to the recall issue and more than 2,100 warranty reports.
Ford said Thursday it had 29 claims of vehicles exhibiting symptoms of malfunctioning screens after getting the 2023 recall repair. Ford said it has 250 warranty reports alleging malfunctioning rear camera images after getting the 2023 recall repair and one allegation of a minor crash related to a loss of rear-view camera image.
The NHTSA in August 2021 opened an investigation after Ford in 2020 recalled 620,246 vehicles for another rear camera issue. The investigation is reviewing if Ford had recalled the vehicles in a timely fashion and if it recalled enough vehicles.

Workhorse Group Q1 loss grows but makeover nears completion,15-May-23,The stepvan chassis market is dominated by Ford Motor Co. and Freightliner  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-group-q1-loss-grows-204455562.html,"Workhorse Group lost $25 million in the first quarter but made progress on a company overhaul.
Workhorse Group reported a larger loss in the first quarter and is short on cash. But it made progress toward ramping up Class 4 electric stepvans and chassis cabs.
The Cincinnati-based company is slowly emerging from an extensive and expensive overhaul led by CEO Rick Dauch. Since he joined the company in August 2021, he has:
Fired several top executives, replacing them with automotive industry veterans and veteran automotive engineers.
Used company shares to pay off a hedge fund, leaving the company debt free.
Canceled the C-1000 electric stepvan program found to be insufficiently durable to last the 15-20 years required of delivery vans.
Arranged to purchase 1,800 Class 4 chassis from Canada’s GreenPower Motor Co. as a stopgap product to generate revenue. The new Workhorse W56 Class 5 van will be ready n Q3. A Class 4 homemade product arrives in 2025.
Spent $50 million to makeover Workhorse’s shabby plant in Union City, Indiana.
Early buds of progress from these and other moves showed up in the first quarter despite Workhorse posting a net loss of $25 million compared to $22.1 million in the same period last year. Workhorse delivered 10 upgraded GreenPower-based W4 CC chassis cabs to a customer. It expects 40 more vehicles to be delivered this quarter.
“After almost two years of hard work, Workhorse is ready to run,” Dauch told analysts on an earnings call Monday.
Investors seemed less sure. Workhorse shares closed at 88 cents Monday, a few pennies above its 52-week low.
Workhorse revenues rose in 1st quarter
Not counting returns and allowances, Q1 sales rose to $1.7 million compared to $14,300 in the same period last year as the company was in the midst of halting production of the C-1000 vans, which it tried to improve before ultimately canceling the project. Expenses rose this year in part because Workhorse did not furlough hourly workers as it halted production.
Workhorse had $79.1 million in cash at the end of March, including $18.6 million raised from an at-the-market direct sales arrangement. Workhorse will continue to tap the ATM as needed but has enough cash to get through 2023. The company maintains projected revenue of $75 million to $125 million this year with a profitable margin on every truck sold.
“On all fronts we are pushing the boundaries and overcoming the challenges as we create a commercially successful OEM,” Dauch said. “We will have the types of vehicles they need across the Class 4-6 segment.”
Another shot at a 1st-mover advantage
Workhorse, founded in 2007, squandered two first-mover advantages to make electric vans. Thanks to federal and state incentives, it is getting a third try to get its products into the market ahead of other newcomers, several of them startups.
“This company has a history of designing some pretty unique trucks and selling them for about half what they put into them,” Dauch said. “So we put an edict out when we got here that we’re going to design, test and build trucks that can make money. Just designing, building and selling cool trucks at a loss puts you out of business long term.”
The bill of materials on the C-1000 was $178,000 compared to a selling price of about $80,000, Dauch told FreightWavesTV in a Truck Tech interview.
Workhouse thinks it can carve out niche as 3rd player
The stepvan chassis market is dominated by Ford Motor Co. and Freightliner Custom Chassis Corp., a subsidiary of Daimler Truck North America. Utilimaster, part of the Shyft Group, and Morgan Olson make most van bodies. Workhorse thinks the growing demand for electric vans creates room for it to become the third major player.
The California Air Resources Board’s mandate that 9% of new Class 4-8 trucks be electric by 2024 is a major reason for Dauch’s optimism.
“This is exactly the segment where our products are targeted,” Dauch said. “This is the definition of a target-rich environment for an EV industry pioneer.”
Workhorse could scale to 5,000 vans by 2025 and 10,000 by 2026 if sufficient demand exists to add a second shift, Dauch said.
Workhorse building a dealer network
The W56, which has a few test builds completed, attracted significant interest at recent industry events. The ground-up vehicle went from concept to production in less than two years with fewer than 50 engineers and technicians assigned.
Most of the 8,000 reservations in place when Dauch arrived have gone away because of the C-1000s inadequacies, such as cargo-carrying capability and price. The Pritchard Group doubled down, increasing its order from 500 to 1,000 units.
Workhorse is now trying to build a dealer network for the 22 states where it plans to sell its products. Dauch said 13 manufacturing licenses are in place. Eight more are expected to sign on this year. He mentioned New York and New Jersey, Texas and, of course, California as early markets. Eastern ports in Florida and South Carolina also hold promise.
“We want a handful of dealers so we don’t get into an allocation-type situation,” he said.
Workhorse dealers typically will be required to order 10 vehicles for stock. The plant is currently building five W4 CC units a day.

All You Need to Know About Ford Motor Company (F) Rating ...,24-May-23,Wall Street Analysts Think NIO Inc. (NIO) Could Surge 59.92%: Read This  Before Placing a Bet. 5h ago. Yahoo Finance. Tesla (finally) releases  updated Model 3...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-ford-motor-company-f-160008116.html,"Investors might want to bet on Ford Motor Company (F), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.
As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ford Motor Company is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.
Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Ford Motor Company imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ford Motor Company
This company is expected to earn $1.70 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.6%.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ford Motor Company. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 12.8%.
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Ford Motor Company to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which is up 95%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 32% (not including dividends).
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
View our latest analysis for Ford Motor
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During three years of share price growth, Ford Motor moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
earnings-per-share-growth
It is of course excellent to see how Ford Motor has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.
What About Dividends?
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Ford Motor the TSR over the last 3 years was 117%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
A Different Perspective
Investors in Ford Motor had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.7% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.1%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ford Motor better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Ford Motor (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .

Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sqm-announces-long-term-lithium-141000384.html,"SANTIAGO, Chile, May 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A) and Ford Motor Company have announced a long-term strategic agreement to secure the supply of high-quality lithium products for production of electric vehicles.
The agreement between Ford and SQM will ensure the supply of battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, essential components to manufacture high-performance electric vehicle batteries. The origin of SQM's lithium should help Ford vehicles to qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) consumer tax credit and will help support its plans to produce electric vehicles and expand its presence in the global electric mobility markets.
Carlos Díaz, Executive Vice President Lithium of SQM, said: ""We are pleased to announce this strategic agreement and value Ford's trust in SQM's ability to deliver battery-grade lithium products sustainably produced in Chile. As one of the largest lithium producers in the world, for over 25 years, SQM has been investing in the technology and development of its own processes to produce high value-added lithium products with one of the lowest environmental footprints in the industry. This alliance will allow both companies to contribute further to the decarbonization of the planet on a global scale.""
Added Lisa Drake, Ford's vice president, EV Industrialization, Model e: ""Working with strong global collaborators such as SQM will help us make real progress on making EVs more accessible for our customers down the road.

Ford's deal with Tesla, a brand-new electric SUV, and more
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) jumped 6.2% after announcing late Thursday that it struck a major deal with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that will allow Ford-produced electric vehicles to charge at Tesla Supercharger stations in the U.S. and Canada.
Ford's EV models fitted with the Combined Charging System (CCS) port, namely F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit, will get access to Tesla's V3 Superchargers, although the vehicles will require a Tesla-developed adapter to use the stations. Ford added that starting in 2025, it will begin to equip its cars with Tesla's NACS charging port, eliminating the need for an adapter to use Tesla-branded stations.
The agreement is set to go into effect in spring of 2024. Tesla shares also climbed after the news, by 4.7%.
Separately, Ford also unveiled details Monday about its upcoming three-row electric SUV at its ""Delivering Ford+: Capital Markets"" day. This new model will be similar in size to the Expedition but will not replace it, said Doug Field, Ford's new Chief Officer of EVs and Digital Systems.
The SUV will offer fast charging capability, allowing for 150 miles of range in less than 10 minutes, as well as a total range of 350 miles per charge. It will also be able to cover 300 miles on the highway at 70 mph using a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack.
Before the event, Ford said it had signed multiple deals to secure a supply of lithium products, including lithium hydroxide, in response to intense competition among North American automakers that are all trying to get their hands on enough battery materials.
Ford aims to produce 2 million EV units by the end of 2026, a big jump from its previous estimate of 600,000 units by the end of this year.
Also earlier in the week, Tesla's website confirmed the arrival of China-made Model 3 and Model Y cars in the Great White North, delighting Canadian enthusiasts. By exporting to Canada from Shanghai, Tesla can maintain the supply of vehicles manufactured in California and Texas for the U.S. market, where they qualify for potential tax incentives of up to $7,500.


Emissions Battle
California Air Resources Board (CARB) Tuesday urged the Biden administration to approve a groundbreaking proposal that would require all new vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be either electric or plug-in electric hybrids. This move comes as part of an effort to reduce smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% before 2037.
By contrast, on Thursday, a coalition of 27 Senate Republicans called on the administration to abandon its plans to reduce vehicle emissions, saying that the plan will ""effectively mandate a costly transition to electric cars and trucks in the absence of congressional direction.""
Earlier in the week, a group of 151 House Republicans, spearheaded by Congresswoman Cathy Rodgers, demanded that the EPA withdraw its proposed emissions standards for light and medium-duty vehicles as well as heavy-duty trucks. They called the rules, the ""latest attempt to carry out President Biden’s radical rush-to-green agenda”.
Stellantis Extends Stalemate
Construction of a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, by Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and LG Energy Solution (KS:373220) remains at a standstill. They paused the project on May 15 claiming the federal government wasn't keeping up its end of the deal, which could have meant billions of dollars in incentives.
The federal government quickly pointed fingers at the Ontario government, saying they needed to pay “their fair share” without going into detail.
Premier Doug Ford of Ontario announced on May 19th that his government would provide more financial support to help Stellantis get back to work. However, Ford said on Wednesday during an unrelated event that the future of Stellantis' electric battery plant in Windsor now depends on the federal government after the province offered more money to try and save the deal.
“As you know, we put in our fair share and now we’re stepping up again to put more money because it’s all about the people, it’s all about making sure they have the jobs down in Windsor region and right across southwestern Ontario,” said Ford.
Stellantis shares lost 4.2% for the week to $15.90.
VinFast Recalls Entire North America Shipment
Vietnamese EV automaker VinFast wasn’t as lucky with their North American shipments. The automaker announced Thursday that they are recalling the entirety of their first shipment of vehicles sent to the U.S.
According to a report from the NHTSA, a software issue in the dashboard display of 999 VF 8 vehicles may prevent critical safety information from being shown, posing a potential risk of crashes. Luckily the company can resolve the issue through an over-the-air update.
Nikola's Delisting Threat
Rival EV startup Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) was issued a delisting notice after the company failed to meet the minimum bid price requirements set by the Nasdaq exchange. Shares of the company sank more than 20% to 61 cents by the end of trading on Thursday. Company shares fell about 78% last year on high battery material costs and production concerns.
EV startup Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) was hit with a similar notice last month. The electric automaker enacted a reverse stock split to meet the exchange's rules. The split went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on May 24, bringing their share price over the $1 threshold and staving off delisting fears for now.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ford-ceos-talk-evs-205013445.html,"By Hyunjoo Jin, David Shepardson and Abhirup Roy
(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it has agreed with Tesla Inc to allow its electric vehicle owners to gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers in North America in early 2024.
The tie-up between the rivals makes Ford the first major automaker to embrace Tesla's proprietary charging standard, giving the automaker access to the biggest network of high-speed Superchargers in the United States.
Access to charging stations is considered one of the main hurdles so far to broader acceptance of electric vehicles, analysts have said.
Tesla said last November it would open its proprietary charging design to other automakers and charging network operators.
A Tesla-developed adapter will provide Ford EVs fitted with the Combined Charging System (CCS) port access to Tesla’s V3 Superchargers. Ford will equip future EVs with Tesla's own charging standard, removing the need for an adapter for direct access to Tesla Superchargers, starting in 2025.
""The idea is that we don't want the Tesla supercharger network to be like a walled garden. We want it to be something that is supportive of electrification and sustainable transport in general,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an online Twitter Spaces conversation with Ford CEO Jim Farley.
""We love the locations, we love the reliability, your routing software, the ease of use of the connector, the reliability of it,"" Farley said.
""Tesla storms through the train station like 300 kilometers per hour Shinkansen,"" Farley said, referring to Japanese bullet trains. ""We're learning a lot.""
Tesla had 17,711 Superchargers, accounting for about 60% of total U.S. fast chargers, which can add hundreds of miles of driving range in an hour or less.
Farley on Thursday announced the partnership during the Twitter Spaces conversation. Twitter is owned by Musk.
The event comes just a day after Twitter crashed repeatedly during a highly anticipated live audio chat between Musk and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, setting back Musk's efforts to promote the social media firm he bought for $44 billion last year.
The Musk-Farley Twitter Spaces conversation lasted about a half hour and came off without technical glitches.
Farley said earlier on Thursday at a Morgan Stanley forum that ""on the infrastructure side, I think it's room for some collaboration between the auto companies, which is totally unnatural for us.""
Farley added, ""I think we need to start – I mean, I think the first step is to work together in a way we haven't, probably with the new EV brands and the traditional old companies.""
For example, he called it ""totally ridiculous"" that the industry has multiple plugs for its charging networks and ""we can't even agree on what plug to use.""
Musk earlier this month tweeted: ""I think Ford’s overall strategy with EVs is smart. The electric F-150 (Lightning) has high demand.""
He also defended Ford over its losses on its electric vehicle business. ""Always tough with margins for new vehicle lines, especially when there are major technology shifts.""
Farley said on Thursday that Ford should take the lead to reach out to a new company like a Tesla or a Nio Inc or BYD ""to kind of work together in a non-natural way as competitors. I think you'll see Ford do that just because that's what kind of company we are.""
This year, Tesla has started to expand beyond its proprietary connectors and incorporate the rival CCS standard at some of its charging stations in the United States, as the Biden administration seeks to provide billions in subsidies to expand charging networks.

Ford no longer stuck in 'valuation box' 2nd-gen EVs will ...,22-May-23,"“I think this is a chance for investors to go deep on our strategy” Farley  told Yahoo Finance from Ford's Capital Markets Day event dubbed  ""Delivering Ford+""...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-no-longer-stuck-in-valuation-box-2nd-gen-evs-will-unlock-profitability-ceo-says-141155636.html,"Ford’s (F) transformation into three business units —focusing on gas-powered cars, electric vehicles, and commercial customers — is less than two quarters old. And investors still have a lot of questions for the 120-year-old automaker and how CEO Jim Farley intends to push profitability.
“I think this is a chance for investors to go deep on our strategy,” Farley told Yahoo Finance from Ford’s Capital Markets Day event, dubbed ""Delivering Ford+,"" at the company’s headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. “The main message is that Ford and a lot of the OEMs have been stuck in a valuation box with a lot of capital, low margins, fighting for slivers of market share, and what this investor day is about is explaining how that's changed.”
Ford updated it’s financial outlook to include “financial bridges” that it says will allow it to hit company adjusted EBIT margin of 10% in 2026, “a waypoint” to higher subsequent profitability.
Ford Capital Markets Day 2023 event from Dearborn, Michigan (5/22/23) (Yahoo Finance)
Ford Blue, the traditional gas-powered business, is expected to hit low double-digits in terms of EBIT margin percentage by 2026; Ford Pro is targeting mid-teens, and by late 2026, and Ford’s EV business - Model e - is targeting 8% EBIT margins.
Wall Street has been particularly skeptical of that EV profit margin. But Farley said Ford’s product portfolio and focus on new EVs — including a 3-row SUV that he calls a “personal bullet train” — will take the company there.
“I think you should realize that everyone's product strategy is not a monolith. We have a very unique strategy compared to our competitors. We're going after larger [electric] vehicles where we know the customers really well, three row crossovers with a lot of room in the rear seat, a personal bullet train, a second-generation Lightning [EV],” Farley said.
At the event, Ford said that the 3-row SUV will have 350 miles of range, plus a smaller battery, better aerodynamics, and a lower manufacturing cost than most current EVs.

Farley said its second-gen EVs will have totally different architectures and be software update-able (meaning higher-margin services). That and electrifying its commercial pro fleet will lead to more “durable” returns in the future, he said.
“The main message is we had to design these second generation products completely different than the first-gen products,” Farley says.
A big part of cost control for EVs is making cheaper batteries. To that end, Ford announced deals today in order to gain the materials necessary to hit its 2 million EV run rate by 2026.
Ford’s deal with China’s CATL to build LFP batteries, which are cheaper, and can be charged more frequently with fewer degradation, will be key. However, working with a Chinese partner has not come without criticisms.
“It turns out that the [battery] processing is the most important thing for us,” Farley said. “We're going to build the batteries ourselves. So it's our factory, we're building the factory, it will be our workers in a plant. We're not going to import the batteries that Tesla has been doing.”
Of course, Tesla (TSLA) is front and center in any discussion of EVs, and Farley has been consistent in his praise of the pure-play EV-maker’s efficiency, though he believes Ford is catching up. Tesla’s massive price cuts have put huge pressure on the industry to respond, and Ford answered with Mustang Mach-E price cuts. Farley believes the cuts are here to stay, and those who aren’t prepared may be doomed.
“We are going to see pricing pressure and if you have not put that in your business plan and you haven't designed second-cycle products with discounting included in your run rate to get to an 8% margin in our case, then it's not going to work out,” Farley said.
“That's why we put so much pressure even on the first-gen products, the Mustang [Mach-E] that is, that faces off of the model Y, we've reduced the price of the bill material by $5000,” Farley said. “We have to go deeper to face off with the Model Y and Tesla, and they're discounting; we knew we had to totally redesign the vehicle.”
Despite Ford’s recent focus on the EV transformation, it is the iconic gas powered cars like the F-150 pickup, Ford Bronco, Mustang, and Expedition SUVs that are still the strong sellers that make the company the money that it is plowing into transformation investments.
Farley noted special edition vehicles like the F-150 Raptor, Bronco Raptor, and the upcoming Dark Horse Mustang not only excite customers, but also bring in higher margins. Ford calls these “derivative vehicles""— special vehicles that highlight the brand’s iconic status whose popularity hopefully trickles down to the higher volume vehicles.
Henry Ford, the namesake of the facility here for Capital Markets day, wanted to build cars for everyone. Farley has a different path for the future.
“We don't want to do generic vehicles anymore,” he said. “We don't want to be all things to all people.”

Warren Buffett Says Electric Vehicle Market Too Tough to ...,26-May-23,Buffett referred to Ford Motor Co.'s dominance in the automobile market ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-electric-vehicle-144153723.html,"Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett emphasized the prevailing uncertainty in the electric vehicle (EV) market during the company's annual meeting. Buffett stated there would be no clear winner in the sector, as the industry is highly unpredictable and subject to constant change.
Don’t Miss: Why Jason Calacanis and Other Silicon Valley Elites Are Betting On This Startups Vision For Re-Uniting American Families
Buffett referred to Ford Motor Co.'s dominance in the automobile market years ago because of the success of the Model T. But after two decades, the company faced substantial losses. This historical example serves as a cautionary tale for Tesla Inc., which holds the largest market share of any EV manufacturer in the United States. Nevertheless, Tesla faces mounting competition, although its competitors have not yet reached Tesla's position because of challenges in the supply chain and funding issues.
Tesla is down as much as 21% in the past 12 months. As the EV market and makers like Tesla continue to struggle for growth, some retail investors have looked to the startups market. For example, Civilized Cycles launched on Wefunder and has seen substantial traction from retail investors.
Recent reports indicate that U.S. EV startups continue to burn through cash without showing tangible progress amid a challenging economic backdrop marked by declining EV demand. Thomas Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital, expressed concern over companies that are losing money and have a low valuation, highlighting the vulnerability of EVs in this regard.
Even established players such as General Motors Co. and Ford are experiencing financial difficulties in their EV divisions. GM, while aiming to halt cash burn by 2025, is struggling in this area. Ford reported a loss of $722 million in the first quarter for its EV division, translating to over $66,000 per vehicle, as energy market analyst Robert Bryce disclosed.

Tesla also faces challenges, including the need to reduce prices to maintain demand and the impact of raw material inflation on profit margins. Federal government subsidy plans under the Inflation Reduction Act could exacerbate these issues.
Berkshire Hathaway has extensive holdings in various industries, including a dealership group with over 100 franchises representing 27 automakers across 10 states. But Buffett and his trusted associate Charlie Munger have made it clear that they are not inclined to further expand their involvement in the auto business.
Buffett expressed their long-held belief that the auto industry is a formidable field, stating, ""Charlie and I long have felt that the auto industry is just too tough. It’s just a business where you’ve got a lot of worldwide competitors, they're not going to go away, and it looks like there are winners at any given time, but it doesn’t get you a permanent place.""
This sentiment resonates with their cautious approach to venturing deeper into the industry despite their current holdings, which include roughly 40 million shares in General Motors. This is down from the 50 million shares they owned in 2022.
Munger echoed Buffett's sentiment, acknowledging the significant rise of electric vehicles but emphasizing the associated capital costs and risks.
""The electric vehicle is coming big time, and that’s a very interesting development,” said. “At the moment, it's imposing huge capital costs and huge risks, and I don't like huge capital costs and huge risks.""
Instead of embracing the automotive sector further, Buffett emphasized the importance of identifying opportunities with greater certainty. He contrasted his confidence in predicting Apple Inc.'s trajectory in the coming years with the unpredictable nature of the car companies, stating, ""I think I know where Apple’s going to be in five or 10 years, and I don't know what the car companies are going to be in five or 10 years.""

Tesla Worksport And Ford Are Putting EV Words Into Action,23-May-23,With CEO Steven Rossi at the helm the automotive accessory and renewable  energy company ... Yahoo Finance. Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power  gaming and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-worksport-ford-putting-ev-171836829.html,"On Monday, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) unveiled its ambitious strategy to ramp up its EV progress and catch up to the EV leader itself, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). Today, Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP)(NASDAQ: WKSPW), who will be equipping several upcoming electric pickups with its revolutionary solar-powered technology, revealed it is another step closer to beginning production as first materials have arrived at its NY manufacturing facility.
Ford Aims To Restore Its Credibility On Wall Street
Back in February, the blue oval already predicted a tough year ahead and now it estimated that compared to its competitors, its total costs are $7 billion higher. To complete its targeted goal of producing 2 million EVs by 2026, Ford also revealed its new supply deals for battery-grade lithum. Ford already claimed to achieve a global capacity to build 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023, but Wall Street is doubting about its ability to achieve this ambitious goal. Besides maintaining its 2023 guidance for adjusted EBIT in the range between $9 billion and $11 billion and about $6 billion in adjusted free cash flow, Ford also stated that the next-generation electric truck will have a 30% lower labor and overhead cost compared to its current trucks powered by internal combustion engines.
Tesla’s Long-Promised Cybertruck Finally In Production
Tesla plans to begin delivering its Cybertruck pickup to customers later this year while its CEO, Elon Musk, also teased two new models last week. Musk will also be joining The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit at 2 p.m. ET in a virtual appearance.
The Cybertruck promises to redefine the look of pickups while it’s marketed as „the Hummer of the 2020s“. It’s safe to say that until now, Tesla has shown it is more than able to push the boundaries on what its electric vehicles can do.
Worksport’s Solar-Powered Products Are Coming
With CEO Steven Rossi at the helm, the automotive accessory and renewable energy company is making big steps to solidify its position in these industries that will redefine the future of transportation. With the factory just having received the first materials, Worksport is a step closer to bring its groundbreaking products to market, Terravis solar-powered tonneau covers and COR portable power source and energy storage system. Electric pickups Atlis XT and Alpha are among those who will be super-powered by Worksport’s revolutionary technology.
Legacy automakers have long talked about their approach to profitably shifting away from international combustion engines to EVs, but now is the time to put their words into action while the EV king, Tesla, and other innovative players in the field like Worksport continue redefining the automotive landscape of tomorrow.

Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power  gaming and AI...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ford-motor-company-f-153118209.html,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Ford Motor Company (F). Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ford Motor Company due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
Ford Q1 Earnings Top Estimates & Rise Y/Y
Ford reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share for first-quarter 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and increasing from 38 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected automotive revenues resulted in the outperformance. The company’s consolidated first-quarter revenues came in at $41,474 million, rising 20.3% year over year.
Segmental Performance
The U.S. legacy automaker has started reporting its automotive results under three business segments — Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro. Till now, it used to report on the basis of geographical regions.While Ford Blue focuses on the firm’s legacy gas-powered business, Ford Model e focuses on EVs, advanced technologies and several related aspects to support electrification plans. Meanwhile, Ford Pro will deal with commercial vehicles and services.
In the first quarter, total wholesale volume in the Ford Blue segment increased 6% year over year to 706,000. Revenues from the segment increased 21% year over year to $25 billion. Earnings before interest and taxes came in at $2,623 million with EBIT margin of 10.4%.
Total wholesale volume in the Ford Model e segment decreased 32% year over year to 12,000. Revenues from the segment tailed off 27% year over year to $0.7 billion. Loss before interest and taxes came in at $722 million with EBIT margin of negative 102.1%.
Total wholesale volume in the Ford Pro segment increased 18% year over year to 337,000. Revenues from the segment grew 28% year over year to $13.2 billion. Earnings before interest and taxes came in at $1,366 million with EBIT margin of 10.3%.
Overall, Ford’s total automotive revenues came in at around $39 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.7 billion.
First-quarter revenues from the Ford Credit unit came in at $2,389 million, up 4.7% year over year, and came ahead of the consensus mark of $2,277 million. Pretax earnings totaled $303 million, falling from $928 million in the year-ago quarter and lagging the consensus mark of $374 million.
Financial Position
Ford reported adjusted free cash flow (FCF) of $693 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $22,144 million as of Mar 31, 2023, compared with $25,134 million on Dec 31, 2022. Long-term debt excluding Ford Credit totaled $19.1 billion at the end of first quarter of 2023, down from $19.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.
Guidance
Adjusted EBIT for 2023 is estimated to be in the range of $9 billion-$11 billion. Adjusted FCF is envisioned at $6 billion. Ford anticipates 2023 EBIT from Ford Blue and Ford Pro to come in at $7 billion and $6 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, Ford Model e is expected to incur a pretax loss of around $3 billion this year.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.
VGM Scores
At this time, Ford Motor Company has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Ford Motor Company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.
Performance of an Industry Player
Ford Motor Company is part of the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. Over the past month, Tesla (TSLA), a stock from the same industry, has gained 27%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.
Tesla reported revenues of $23.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.4%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.
Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.
Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of D.

Ford Tesla 'blindside' industry with charging deal - what it ...,03-Jun-23,Yahoo Finance. Ford Tesla 'blindside' industry with charging ... Jim  Farley CEO of the Ford Motor Company talks during the official launch...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-tesla-blindside-industry-with-charging-deal-heres-what-it-means-for-automakers-and-customers-180010414.html,"Leave it to Ford and its new bedfellow Tesla to shock the automotive world.
On the eve of Memorial Day weekend, Ford CEO Jim Farley announced he would be joining Tesla CEO Elon Musk for a Twitter Spaces discussion, where the two would talk about ""accelerating EV adoption,"" and make an announcement.
That announcement turned out to be a big one: Starting next year, Ford EVs will have access to 12,000 Tesla Superchargers in North America, via a Tesla-supplied adapter. Then starting in 2025, all new Ford EVs will ship with Tesla’s NACS (North American Charging Standard) charging connector, as opposed to the CCS standard which most other EV automakers have been using.
""Working with Elon and his team, I’m really excited for our industry and for the Ford customers,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during the Twitter Spaces event. ""We think this is a huge move for our industry and all electric customers.""

Likewise Musk, who has been known to denigrate traditional automakers though has in the past shown an affinity for Ford, said, ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for Ford as a company, and they make great vehicles,"" adding ""it’s an honor to be working with a great company like Ford.""
Farley cited the Tesla’s supercharger network’s ease of use and reliability as key differentiators for using the service. Ford did reiterate that its own BlueOval Charge Network of 10,000+ fast chargers would still be available, giving Ford owners more choice, and a big leg up on the competition with Tesla’s network on tap.
Reaction across the automotive world was mixed, but one thing was for certain: it was a shock.
""Ford blindsided the entire industry with this brilliant move and solidified its position as a leader in the transition to electric vehicles,"" said Tom Moloughney, EV charging expert and senior editor at InsideEVs to Yahoo Finance. ""The Ford/Tesla deal will cause some initial disruption in the industry, but it will prove to be good for the consumer in the long run.""
Wall Street is generally supportive of the deal as well, with Ford owners (and presumptive owners) receiving a big benefit that could help sell more of the company’s EVs.
""To the extent it helps Ford sell more EVs, it also reinforces the importance of getting to profitability on those vehicle sales,"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note to investors. ""Ford discussed having EVs that can charge quickly (and have a smaller battery) as part of its strategy to improve user experience and profits at its recent investor day, and we view this step to enhance the charging network as a step toward that.""
""In terms of vehicles on the road and fast charge ports, NACS is the leading standard in the US,"" Guidehouse Sr. Research Analyst Mike Austin told Yahoo Finance. ""I think it’s a good move for Ford, or at least not a negative – everyone (Tesla and other automakers) will probably need an adapter one way or the other anyway – so getting access to Superchargers requires moving to NACS, it’s probably worth it.""

Even Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg expressed support for the Ford/Tesla deal as good for consumers.
""We're really glad to see this deal and any deal that means more access for more drivers to more electric chargers,"" Secretary Buttigieg said in an interview with Yahoo Finance this week. ""We are on an aggressive journey to get to the president's vision of half a million chargers by the end of the decade across America, and there's already this remarkable charging network that Tesla has built. So for that to be accessible to more drivers is, I think, very positive news.""
Buttigieg continued that regardless of charger plug standard - CCS vs NACS or even the CHAdeMo standard that Nissan uses, the availability of adapters for interoperability will be crucial. Most importantly for consumers is for the sheer number of chargers to increase, and those networks are opened up to all users. Tesla has promised to open up more of its Supercharger network to other users by the end of next year, but the rollout is coming along slowly.
Not surprisingly, automakers that are tied to the CCS standard, as well as charging companies aligned with a more agnostic approach to charging standards, aren’t ready to anoint Ford’s tie-up with NACS as a game changer.
""GM believes that open charging networks and standards are the best way forward to enable EV adoption across the industry,"" a GM spokesperson said to Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""That’s why we joined with a group of companies and the SAE to develop and continue to refine an open connector standard in the Combined Charging System (CCS), which we believe is a truly universal solution available today for fast charging.""
""EVgo remains committed to Electric For All, and we continue to be ready to charge any and all EVs on our network, including Fords, Teslas, and dozens of other models,"" EVgo said to Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We're looking forward to learning more about how this partnership will be implemented.""
There is some concern from Tesla owners about Ford EV owners potentially clogging their Supercharger stalls in the future, but the high availability rate of Tesla’s chargers and relatively small user base of Ford EV owners should likely mitigate any concerns about availability.
Again, Wall Street is somewhat bullish on the deal for Tesla.
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in his note. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""
""The main upside for Tesla is that it helps increase Supercharger revenue (and utilization). Compared to cars this is low capital and steady revenue, and opening it up to non-Tesla vehicles effectively turns it into a standalone business unit,"" Guidehouse’s Mike Austin said.
EV charging expert Tom Moloughney was even more effusive in what this deal means for Tesla.
""Tesla isn't just a car company, it's an energy provider, and as such, the more customers the better,"" Moloughney told Yahoo Finance. ""As long as Tesla continues to install Superchargers as it has been, the Supercharger experience will remain the best charging experience in the industry, even if other OEMs also join in.""
Will NACS be the new standard?

The next logical question following Ford’s move: Will others follow suit and effectively make the NACS standard the main system and plug going forward?
""The CCS is a great standard, but it was pretty much done by kind of a committee, and I think GM and others are going to have a big choice to make,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said to CNBC. ""Do they want to have fast charging for customers? Or do they want to stick to their standard and have less charging?""
As Buttigieg pointed out, if adapters for various plugs exist then any charger will do, however that will be a long time coming, and there is no guarantee the adapters will work as seamlessly as native plugs work now.
The Tesla Supercharger experience is true ""plug and play,"" meaning once the plug is connected to the car, the Supercharger system ""knows"" the car, has billing information already on hand, and begins charging. With other networks an app or charger interface must be dealt with, a specific charger selected in the interface, sometimes payment info must be entered, etc., before charging begins.
As the EV battlefield grows more intense, it’s possible other manufacturers may hop over to the NACS side to get a better user experience, but that would also mean joining forces with Tesla - a bitter pill to swallow for traditional automakers who have felt under attack from the Musk-led company.
For now, it seems Tesla’s NACS is in a better position for wider adoption.
""It’s possible,"" Mike Austin said about whether NACS could be the new standard in the US, ""but I think it’s too soon to tell – the Ford vehicles with NACS ports won’t come out until 2025 and it will take a few years after that for all of its EVs to switch over. It’s also possible that Ford could offer both ports.""
Moloughney offered a similar sentiment, but added the tide may be turning.
""That's still not likely, but it opens the door,"" he says. ""NACS desperately needed a major OEM like Ford to support it for it to have a chance of becoming the main standard. They have that now.""
Note: an earlier version of this story mislabeled Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as Treasury Secretary; that error has been corrected.

Ford Motor Co sues Blue Cross Blue Shield in antitrust case ...,01-Jun-23,The case is Ford Motor Co v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Mutual  Insurance ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-co-sues-blue-180747319.html,"By Mike Scarcella
(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co sued Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in U.S. court on Wednesday, accusing it of a price-fixing conspiracy that caused the automaker to pay inflated costs for health insurance products for its employees.
The lawsuit Ford filed in Detroit federal court accused the insurer and its regional Michigan branch of unlawfully dividing up parts of the country in a scheme to reduce competition with each other in order to drive ""astronomical profits.""
The allegations from Ford, employing more than 170,000 workers worldwide, relate to a $2.7 billion settlement that Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and its three dozen member companies reached in 2020 with corporate and individual policy holders in Alabama federal court.
Ford opted out of that settlement, which is now on appeal at the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in order to pursue its own claims. The appeals court agreed to fast-track its consideration of the settlement.
A spokesperson for defendant Blue Cross Blue Shield Association declined to comment on pending litigation. A representative from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan also declined to comment.
Ford did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the lawsuit, and a lawyer for the company declined to comment.
In the 40-page complaint, Ford said the alleged scheme to curb competition among Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations deprived the vehicle manufacturer of ""the opportunity to purchase health insurance products and services from a lower cost competitor and/or at a price set by the free market.""
The lawsuit seeks to bar Blue Cross Blue Shield's alleged anticompetitive conduct, and it also seeks triple damages and other remedies.
Ford said it had spent more than $500 million on premiums since 2009 for ""fully insured"" products for employees in designated areas in the state, according to the complaint.
Ford's lawsuit said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan is the country's ninth largest insurer based on its 4.5 million enrollees.
The case is Ford Motor Co v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Mutual Insurance Company and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, No. 2:23-cv-11286-LVP-EAS.

(Photo: C.H. Robinson)
C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRW) has chosen David Bozeman, an executive of the Ford Motor Co., as its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.
David Bozeman (Photo: Ford)
The announcement, which is expected to be made as early as Monday, catapults Bozeman to the top job of the nation’s largest freight broker.
Bozeman is currently vice president of the customer services division and enthusiast brands at Ford (NYSE: F). Before joining the automaker last August, Bozeman spent five-plus years as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services. Before that, he spent more than eight years in top positions at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and more than 16 years at Harley-Davidson Motor Co. (NYSE: HOG).
The choice of Bozeman may come as a surprise to many who thought that Jim Barber, a former COO at UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), to be the odds-on choice for the job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.
During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the end of June. Company executives were not immediately available for comment.
Like virtually all brokers, Robinson has struggled with a sharp downturn in demand. Robinson had also struggled in recent months amid concerns about increased competition from the likes of new broker RXO Inc. (NYSE: RXO). However, it had lost market share in general in what had before been a historically strong environment for contract brokerage, from which Robinson generates most of its revenue.
Robinson also overspent significantly on personnel to support load-matching technology that executives thought would disrupt traditional brokerage but had failed to generate the expected returns on investment. One of the sources in January criticized Robinson for investing $1 billion in IT projects, including the much publicized Navisphere load-matching platform that never lived up to expectations.

Ford CEO says EV cost parity may not come until after 2030,31-May-23,FILE PHOTO: Ford Motor Company's Chief Executive Jim Farley speaks with  analysts at Ford's Capital Markets Day ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners ·  Personal...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-says-ev-cost-145750667.html,"By Shivansh Tiwary and Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - The cost to make electric vehicles may not drop to the level for gas-powered cars until after 2030 when the process becomes simpler and less labor-intensive, Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Wednesday.
At an investor conference, Farley said that, for many automakers, EVs will remain more costly than their internal combustion engine counterparts until the second and third generation models go into production later in this decade.
Analysts have predicted that EV cost parity could come as soon as 2025.
Between 2030 and 2035, Farley added, much of the industry's EV cost savings will come from ""dramatically lower labor content"" because the vehicles will be simpler to build with fewer parts, and will be fitted with smaller batteries that use cheaper materials.
He also predicted the industry could realize lower distribution costs from selling EVs online, as well as higher revenue from new software-driven digital services.
Farley said Ford's software services business has 600,000 subscribers, triple the number a year ago.
That includes 200,000 retail customers paying for the company's Blue Cruise driver assistance system and 400,000 Ford Pro commercial customers paying for a range of services including fleet management, EV charging, dynamic routing and more.
As the company expands its ability to harvest data from vehicles and drivers, Ford could follow other automakers, including Tesla Inc and General Motors Co, in offering insurance, he said.
Asked about the potential for industry-wide consolidation over the next five years, Farley instead predicted an ""acceleration of cooperation,"" citing such deals as Ford's recent agreement to use Tesla's supercharger network for its future EVs.
""Cooperation is essential,"" he said, especially for companies that may not have the resources to build out a full EV ecosystem.

A Game-Changing And Surprising Tesla And Ford Pact To ...,30-May-23,Last Thursday Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) revealed it has joined forces  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-changing-surprising-tesla-ford-183115760.html,"Last Thursday, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) revealed it has joined forces with no other than the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) so its electric vehicles can be charged at Tesla’s Supercharger stations across the U.S. and Canada. The agreement is set to go into effect in the spring of 2024. The surprise deal that was revealed during a live audio discussion between Ford CEO Jim Farley and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter Spaces is troubling for General Motor (NYSE: GM), Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) and other EV players. Upon the announcement, Tesla shares climbed by 4.7% while Ford shares rose 6.2%.
The Pact
As of 2025, Ford’s cars will be equipped with Tesla's NACS charging port, Until then, Ford's EV models, currently F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit that have the Combined Charging System (CCS) port, will be accessing Tesla's V3 Superchargers with a specific adapter.
Ford is among the first automakers to explicitly become part of Tesla’s network.
As of next year, Ford’s owners will be able to access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. Tesla says it has roughly 45,000 Supercharger connectors across the globe at 4,947 Supercharger Stations. Moreover, Ford's next generation of EVs which should arrive by 2025 will be able to use these superchargers without needing an adapter.
The Changing Industry Norm
The current industry norm is the CCS charger, while Tesla vehicles and its Supercharger network use NACS. The charging infrastructure is considered crucial to global EV adoption. Yet, Stellantis, GM and other automakers don’t have access to as many fast chargers as only Tesla has successfully built its own charging network with its charges ranking best for overall customer satisfaction last year, according to a survey from J.D. Power. Not to mention the fact that according to another study from the same source, at least 1 in 5 charging attempts overall failed in 2022, giving Tesla an even greater lead on the charging front. It is important to note that electric vehicles from Stellantis and General Motors, as well as others, can still use Tesla's superchargers, but through Tesla's specific adapter.
Tesla’s Long Game
During the Twitter chat, Musk said that by collaborating with Ford, and perhaps others, customers will be better off its NACS becomes the standard. It seems that General Motors, Stellantis and others have been given the invitation to join Tesla's supercharging network.
Ford’s New SUV
Last week during its “Delivering Ford+” day, Ford also unveiled details about its upcoming three-row electric SUV revealing it will be similar in size to the Expedition, with a fast-charging ability of 150 miles of range in less than 10 minutes, with a total range of 350 miles per charge.
Lithium
Before the event, Ford already revealed it signed multiple deals to secure a supply of lithium battery materials.
Ford Continues Pursuing Its Ambitious Goals
Ford continues its race towards producing 2 million EV units by the end oTesla to export to Canada from Shanghaif 2026, jumping even more compared to its targeted 600,000 produced units by the end of this year.
Also last week, Tesla's website delighted its Canadian fans, confirming the export of China-made Model 3 and Model Y. With this move, Tesla can maintain the supply of EVs manufactured in the U.S., namely California and Texas, for the U.S. market where they are eligible for tax incentives that add up to $7,500 in savings.

5 Reasons to Buy Tesla Right Now
Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making affordable electric vehicles for the masses. Though there have been many naysayers along the way, shares have increased by more than 12,000%. Despite a brutal correction in 2022, the EV maker has delivered positive earnings surprises in nine straight quarters, and shares have begun to recover as a result.
Below are five reasons the momentum can continue into year-end:
A Plethora of Catalysts
Price Cuts Sparking Demand: Over the years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has often said that the EV maker has a supply problem, not a demand problem. However, in early 2023, Musk boldly cut prices to counter rising interest rates that are driving financing costs higher, compete with rivals, and allow several models to be eligible for the hefty $7,500 tax rebates for electric vehicles. (Allowed on EVs under 55,000 and electric SUVs and trucks under $80,000).
Stock Repurchase Plan: Apple is the best example of using buybacks to its advantage. AAPL has the most aggressive share repurchase plan on Wall Street, and the success of the strategy is undeniable. Stock buybacks increase earnings per share (The total number of shares outstanding decreases), create a favorable imbalance between supply and demand (Publics supply of shares is lower), and imply that the stock is undervalued and that it expects future growth. In Tesla’s recent earnings calls, Elon Musk suggested that the company would do a “meaningful buyback” in the fourth quarter of 2023.
A Hummer Replacement? In the early 2000s, General Motors saw a wave of success with its best-selling Hummer SUV. The eccentric army truck became popular with people from all walks of life who wanted to stand out on the roads. However, during the 2008 financial crisis, the viability of the Hummer came into question. Not only was the economy working against it, but sky-high oil prices also made its gas-guzzling nature unattractive, and the green movement in the United States was beginning and consumers were looking to decrease their carbon emissions.
Later this year, Tesla will launch its “Hummer killer,” the obnoxious-looking Cybertruck. The Cybertruck SUV is unlikely to run into the same issues the Hummer did for two reasons. First, unlike in 2008, 2023’s economy is not on the brink of collapse. If you use the Tesla Model Y SUV sales as a precedent, consumers are not only attracted to EVs, but also willing to pay a premium. Second, because the Cybertruck is fully electric, it will attract environmentally conscious consumers.
Full Self-Driving (FSD) Deployment: Tesla continues to refine and improve its AI-powered self-driving program. Already, FSD is much safer than the average driver on the road. In a recent interview, Musk seemed very bullish on FSD’s potential, saying “Tesla will have a Chat-GPT moment later this year.” Musk should know – he was the brains and investment behind Open AI’s Chat-GPT.
Electrifying “Non-Automotive” Growth: Over the last few years, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues have been growing at a CAGR of 47%. Tesla’s “Megapack” deployment is expected to rocket higher by 135% in 2023.
Valuation
Price to Sales at Bargain Basement Levels: Because of Tesla’s dominance in the EV realm, innovation, and high growth, it garners a higher valuation than traditional automakers such as Honda Motor Co. and Ford. That said, from a price-to-sales perspective, TSLA is at its most attractive level since the start of the post-pandemic recovery on Wall Street. The last time Tesla’s P/S ratio was at 8 (like it is now), shares increased sevenfold over the next several months.
Financial Efficiency
Return on Equity: Typically, automakers are known for having razor-thin margins. For Tesla, this isn’t the case. Tesla’s return on equity of 27.29% is higher than the S&P 500’s 25.67% over the trailing twelve months.
The “Magic Elixir”
Growth and Liquidity: Large institutional growth investors consider two major factors when selecting stocks: growth and liquidity. Tesla has grown its top and bottom lines at a healthy double-digit rate for years all while having a market cap north of $500 billion – an extremely rare feat.
Long-Term Area of Interest
A Rare Technical Zone: In monster stocks, the 50-week moving average is a long-term level that investors often defend. Tesla has held the zone since its inception in 2010 and is making a rare visit.
Tesla also jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time since 2022 – another bullish sign.
Conclusion
A plethora of catalysts, a bargain basement valuation, financial efficiency, growth and liquidity, and strong technical action are key reasons why Tesla’s stock should be higher 6-12 months from now.

Ford Motor Company (F) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here ...,07-Jun-23,Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo Finance  Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us · Terms  and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-attracting-130013307.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 23.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $1.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -7.5%. This estimate has changed +6.9% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.70 indicates a change of -1.9% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $39.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.22 billion and $160.03 billion estimates indicate +7.5% and -0.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $39.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.7%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.38 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +57.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

The Method
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$116b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$116b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$31b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$72b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$13.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.

The Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Ford Motor
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.
Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.
Next Steps:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

F surpassed resistance at the 200-day moving average, suggesting a long-term bullish trend.
A useful tool for traders and analysts, the 200-day simple moving average helps determine long-term market trends for stocks, commodities, indexes, and other financial instruments. It moves higher or lower in conjunction with longer-term price performance, and serves as a support or resistance level.
Shares of F have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 9%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, suggesting that F could be poised for a continued surge.
The bullish case solidifies once investors consider F's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 7 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.
Investors should think about putting F on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.

Chicago, IL – June 5, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BNP Paribas SA BNPQY, Ford Motor Company F and KBC Group NV KBCSY.
Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:
5 Reasons to Add BNPQY, F and KBCSY to Your Portfolio
Stock selection can be a tricky business in the best of times. Not only do you need to find stocks with good growth potential, but you also need to see that the potential in your selections exceeds that in other stocks out there. Otherwise you end up missing out on opportunities. Since we are always balancing inflation, the economy and our personal situation anyway, missing opportunities is obviously an undesired outcome.
If you’re somebody who hasn’t done a lot of investing in the past, there are a few simple rules.
Number one, start small. Use cash that you can afford to lose. And go for safe stocks. What these might be, we’ll get to in a minute.
Point number two, even if the stock looks safe from a quick appraisal, learn more about the company. How does it generate revenue? Where? Does it manufacture its own products? Does it incorporate third-party components in its products? What could be the factors affecting revenue generation? Does it offer a service? What is the market demand for its product or service? Is it a growing market?
There could be so many questions to ask and answer. Therefore, do take the time to try and really understand the company. If you understand the company, you have a better idea of how economic factors may affect it.
Number three, talk to somebody who’s been doing this for a while. You could pick up tips and tricks. If you’re consulting an investment advisor, chances are they’ll have a tailored strategy for you. One such strategy is outlined below. If you’re feeling risk-averse, as its probably advisable to be when you’re starting out, this strategy could work for you very well:
Go Large: Large-cap stocks are typically those that have a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. They tend to be safer because they’ve been in business longer. They’re likely to have experienced management and a proven business model. They’re also more likely to have relationships with suppliers and customers. All these factors help to make the business relatively stable in times of economic concern or when the business cycle turns down. The downside of investing in these stocks is that they usually have slower growth rates. So you may have to be more patient with them.
Prefer Income: If you are to hold a stock for a considerable period of time and not get unnerved at all the market gyrations, it will help to see some income. Additionally, stocks that pay dividends add a layer of stability to share prices because dividends increase the total return. If you’re not in need of cash, you may even use the dividend to increase your holdings. One downside to this is: in an inflationary market, the value of fixed dividends will deteriorate. But most companies also increase the dividend periodically, which may offset this to some extent.
Look Forward: The way to understand the future prospects of a company is not only by studying its past performance, but also consulting the experts, or broker analysts. Analysts typically prepare models projecting past performance into the future. Thus, they’re able to estimate earnings for the immediately following quarters and years, as well as for the long term.
The best part of investing in large-cap stocks is that there are usually a significant number of analysts following them, which provides us with average estimates, such as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. If you’re planning to hold a stock for the long term, it may help to check the long-term growth estimates provided by analysts.
Choose Attractive Industries: At any given time, the industry to which a company belongs has some bearing on its performance. There are almost always some factors that affect the entire industry. For example, a chip shortage last year impacted volumes of the entire auto industry, Similarly, rising oil prices were an important factor driving results at oil & gas companies.
Therefore, if you choose industries with good long-term potential (such as EVs, AI, etc), this will increase your chances of success. Zacks makes this easier through its Industry Rank system, which is a way to rank industries that have been previously classified by Zacks. The number of Zacks-classified industries is around 250 and historical data shows that the top 50% outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1. Of course, the higher the rank, the greater the chances of outperformance.
Other Tools from Zacks: At Zacks, we also have a system of ranking stocks based on the chances of their near-term performance. The Zacks Rank for stocks (#1 Strong Buy, #2 Buy, #3 Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell) also captures recent estimate revisions. Zacks also has a Style Score System, which grades stocks based on their Value, Growth or Momentum potential.  Rank 1 and Value Score A or B.
BNPQY, F and KBCSY satisfy all the criteria as good stocks to buy and hold now. So, let’s take a look at some details:
BNP Paribas SA
BNP is a well-known brand providing banking and financial products and services in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and the Asia Pacific. It operates in the Banks – Foreign industry, which is in the top 40% of Zacks-classified industries.
The Zacks Rank #1 stock with Value Score B is expected to grow 17.4% in the long term. It pays a dividend that yields 6.20% (very substantial).
Ford Motor Company

The Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score A. It is expected to grow 6.2% in the long term. Its dividend yields 5.00%.

SEANA SMITH: And that was a closing bell on Wall Street. Again, all three of the major averages ending the trading day in the red. You can see some of the losses extending to the downside here in the final 60 minutes. The Dow closing off just around 200 points. S&P briefly touched the highest level that we've seen in nine months but ended the day in the red, off just about 2/10 of a percent. Then NASDAQ also lower on the day.
Take a look at some of the bigger movers. And first up, we've got to talk about oil prices, closing the day higher after Saudi Arabia said that it has been a slash production, oil production, by a million barrels a day starting in July. The move is expected to help stabilize the oil market with prices tumbling last month on demand concerns. It did close higher but not by much. And Akiko, I think this may be caught some people by surprise, given the fact that we didn't see more of an upside reaction.
AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, when you think about the last cut that they had in the spring, it was sort of similar. But we did see it moved to the upside. Obviously, OPEC Plus wants to get it to above $80 a barrel. It did breach that level. But then it came back down. And that seems to point to what we're seeing looking ahead in terms of what the outlook is. It's about weak demand in the US and Europe but also the fact that the Chinese economy hasn't picked up as quickly as many had expected. That's where a lot of that demand could come from. So interesting to see the Saudis leading on that as well, probably points to where the economic outlook is right now.
All right. Shares of Ford Motor closing the day in the green following an upgrade to buy from neutral from an analyst over at Citi, citing positive demand trends and improved risk reward for the auto giant. Ford's sales grew nearly 11% year-over-year for the month of May. When you talk about a company like Ford, it is really about the two tracks that they continue to push on-- the gas-powered vehicles but also the EV pivot that still is losing money but really trying to gain market share.
SEANA SMITH: It certainly is still losing money. But we have seen some excitement around Ford's initiatives, its venture into EV. The products that they have available today, the F-150 Lightning, has been a very positive reaction from many of those customers. Some really questioning whether or not the pickup driver would be willing to move to an electric vehicle. It looks like at least in these early demand numbers that it is trending in the right direction. They also had that recent partnership with Tesla for their charging network. That is seen as a positive here for both companies.
But Ford does have this momentum moving in the right direction for the company. I think the big question, though, is who is going to be that big competitor to Tesla, and whether or not Ford has enough in order to get there, and the fact that the vehicle still cost so much.
AKIKO FUJITA: And the trucks are really the key, right? You talk about the F-150 Lightning, I keep going back to comments that we heard from Jim Farley very early on when they were getting the reservations in, how surprised he was about the new drivers that were coming in. It wasn't about the usual drivers who already own the gas-powered trucks but also those who are looking at EVs. So that's another thing to consider, I think, is we tend to think, oh, you just switch over from the gas-powered vehicle to the EVs. But others who are saying, look, now that I know it's a little cleaner, maybe I'm willing to get into the F-150 Lightning as well.
Shares of Apple closing lower well off earlier highs after the announcement of the Vision Pro headset. But there were plenty of other movers as well tied to the world developers conference. That includes Intel, Disney, and a name you may not know, Unity Software. That stock popping after Apple said it's working with a company on the headset. And you look specifically at Unity stock, on track for its second largest daily gain since debuting in 2020.
I mean, as Dan said, this is still a huge, huge test. But you've get developers software company like Unity on board there, gaming still is the very first application with technology like this. And if they can get third-party developers in there really churning out the content, that can mean huge upside.
SEANA SMITH: Yeah. That could certainly be the differentiating factor. Clearly, great news here for Unity. You can see that reflected in the stock price today. I think there's lots of questions just about how big of a hit this headset is going to be. Personally, it exceeded my expectations. I was pretty negative on this device going into the event today. They made it much more applicable to everyday usage than I was thinking a headset would be.
Just in terms of what it could do for sports viewing, it could take you essentially courtside to an NBA game. What it could do for entertainment, for some of the movies. We saw Bob Iger up on the stage talking about the partnership between Apple and Disney and the fact that Disney Plus is going to be available on this device day one when it does launch. So I think they did do a great job of laying out the use case. But whether or not this is the device that so many have been hesitant from at least when you take into account some of the VR devices out there, if this is going to be it, probably not given that price tag, but if it sort of paves the way to that mainstream adoption.
AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, one more thing to note here, because we're talking about other stocks that were getting hit, Intel getting hit on the back of the announcement for the M2 chip. It's worth noting, this is for the Mac Pros, three times faster than the old model under Intel. And remember, when they split with Intel, there were questions about how Apple was going to proceed. And this is just another step in moving in that direction.
SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Intel shares closing off just around 4 and 1/2%.","{'negative': 0.8736876195127313, 'neutral': 0.8112972722105358, 'positive': 0.807415548298094}",0.8112972722105358,0.807415548298094,0.8736876195127313

Chicago, IL – June 7, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Ford F and General Motors GM.
Industry: U.S. Auto
Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2104345/2-hot-domestic-auto-stocks-to-harness-the-industrys-tailwinds
Domestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges and capitalize on favorable market trends. With improving inventory, incentives, and the surging popularity of EVs, the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry is well-positioned for a prosperous future. In this article, we delve into the key drivers that are propelling the U.S. auto industry to new heights and why you should not miss out on two top-ranked domestic auto stocks namely — Ford and General Motors — that are riding the wave of industry strength.
About the Industry
The Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.
The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.
Key Investing Themes
Improving Inventory Levels Supporting Pent-Up Demand: With the gradual alleviation of challenges associated with new vehicle production, inventory levels are experiencing significant improvements.According to estimates from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, retail inventory was approximately 1.3 million vehicles at the start of June, reflecting a 48% increase from the previous year. Strong production levels are expected to translate into extended days' supply, thereby providing shoppers with a greater abundance of vehicle options as we move forward.
Sweeter Discount Deals Fueling Sales: The increased inventories resulted in more generous incentives being offered to potential buyers. Several manufacturers, including Ford, Hyundai and General Motors among others, have witnessed a significant surge in their incentive outlays. According to TrueCar, the average incentive amount reached $1,931 last month, representing a 13% increase from April and a substantial 64% increase from May 2022.
By offering generous incentives, automakers and dealers aim to stimulate demand and entice potential buyers into making a purchase. These incentives not only provide financial benefits but also create a sense of urgency and encourage buyers to take advantage of the deals while they last.
Rapidly Increasing EV Popularity Acts as a Vital Catalyst: The rising adoption of green vehicles driven by climate change concerns, technological advancements, and stringent fuel-emission standards is boosting the prospects of the U.S. auto industry. Electric car demand is skyrocketing and EV sales are consistently breaking records.
Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Legacy automakers are making significant efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. The Inflation Reduction Act is set to further fuel EV sales. With the continued momentum and expected future growth, the prospects of the U.S. auto industry in the EV market are highly promising.
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects
The Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it in the top 30% of 250 Zacks industries.
The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.
Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.
Industry Lags S&P 500 But Tops Sector
The Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite but outperformed its larger sector over the past year. The industry has lost 15.8% against the S&P 500's growth of 4.1%. The sector has declined 18.9% over the said time frame.
Industry's Current Valuation
Since automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 14.80X compared with the S&P 500's 12.99X and the sector's 12.22X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 57.29X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 15.31X.
2 Best Stocks to Buy Now
Ford: It is one of the leading automakers in the nation. A strong vehicle mix supported by F-series trucks and SUV models, combined with a robust EV lineup, should drive Ford's growth. The company has tremendous growth opportunities, particularly with highly coveted franchises such as the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco, and, undoubtedly, the Mustang.
Further, Ford's ambitious rejig plan to split its EV business into a separate unit within the company is set to unlock significant growth opportunities. Ford's target of producing over 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 49% CAGR over the span of 2023-2026) augurs well. The company's high liquidity provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities.
Ford currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F's 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The consensus mark for Ford's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 4 cents and 3 cents, respectively, over the past seven days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on two occasions for as many misses, the average surprise being 24.3%.
General Motors: One of the world's largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022.General Motors' compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bode well. The company's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.
Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth.The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors' strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.
GM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4.5%. The consensus mark for GM's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 14 cents and 22 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 15.5%.

Ford (F) Recalls 125K Vehicles Due to Risk of Engine Failure,07-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-recalls-125k-vehicles-165000068.html,"Ford Motor Company F is recalling over 125,000 sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks. Per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the recall includes 86,656 Ford Escapes model years 2020-23, 35,501 Ford Mavericks model years 2022-23 and 3,165 Lincoln Corsairs model years 2021-23.

The recalled vehicles have 2.5L of HEV/PHEV engines that could fail prematurely. Per NHTSA, if the engine fails, engine oil or fuel vapor may be released and accumulate near ignition sources, resulting in fires or smoke.

So far, Ford has received reports of at least three vehicles experiencing a fire, even after getting a recall fix in 2022. Therefore, Ford and NHTSA have advised customers to safely park and shut off the engine if they hear unexpected engine noises, notice a power decrease or see or smell smoke.

The owners of the vehicles will be contacted starting Jun 12, 2023. Per the traffic safety administration, the solution for the engine issue is expected to get ready by the third quarter of 2023.

Last month, Ford recalled more than 175,000 Bronco models due to a defect in the seatbelt latch.

Ford’s vehicle lineup, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickups and SUV models, including the Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport and Edge, is impressive. The automaker remains on track to reach an annualized EV production capacity of 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. It plans to spend around $50 billion by 2026 and targets producing more than 2 million EVs by 2026-end (witnessing a 49% CAGR throughout 2023-2026). By 2030, Ford expects EVs to account for 50% of its global sales.  

On the flip side, Ford’s massive spending on modernization, including connectivity, IT and new product launches, is expected to limit its cash flows in the near term.

10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood,07-Jun-23,Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Ford  Motor Company (NYSE:F) are a few of the most popular stocks on Robinhood  that have...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-popular-stocks-robinhood-120928913.html,"In this article we present the list of 10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are a few of the most popular stocks on Robinhood that have delivered strong returns for the platform’s users since the end of 2020.
The Robinhood app has been a game changer for retail investors, allowing them to quickly and easily trade stocks and build a portfolio of assets while avoiding the hefty fees that have traditionally plagued the investment space.
In place of charging users fees on their trades, Robinhood utilizes a process called payment for order flow, which directs all of the app’s trades through larger entities which can then leverage the power of their increased order sizes to receive more favorable trades. In return, those entities pay a small fee to Robinhood for the use of their trades, the volumes of which can be significant when it comes to the most popular stocks on Robinhood.
The app skyrocketed to popularity during the pandemic, nearly tripling in size from 4.3 million monthly active users in 2019 to 11.7 million a year later. There was another seismic jump to 17.3 million MAUs in 2021 during the height of the meme stock craze, which Robinhood played a noteworthy role in. However, activity on the platform has fell substantially in 2022, declining back to 11.4 million MAUs, though the number of funded accounts inched up to a new high of 23 million.
Robinhood clearly appeals to a younger user base that wants to dip its toes into stock trading but doesn’t have the assets or wherewithal to invest tens of thousands of dollar with brokerage firms like Charles Schwab. The average user account value on Robinhood was just $4,000 in 2021, compared to $234,000 in Charles Schwab’s case.
Given its users’ penchant for small positions and bets on riskier growth stocks, it’s worth looking into the best penny stocks on Robinhood to see which under-the-radar stocks the platform’s users have identified as potential gems. Given that one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is a cannabis stock, it’s unsurprising that several cannabis-based companies also feature prominently among the best  penny stocks on Robinhood according to its users, including Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NASDAQ:ACB) and Jupiter Wellness, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUPW).
On the other end of the spectrum, the most popular stocks on Robinhood feature several of the best stocks to invest in 2023 according to hedge funds and analysts alike, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) (the most popular stock among Robinhood users), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).
When it comes to the performance of Robinhood users’ most popular stocks, it’s been quite a mixed bag as you’ll see in the below results. Five of the ten stocks have been big winners for Robinhood investors, while the other five have been losers, four of them being significant losers, with losses in excess of 23% dating back to January 1, 2021.
Read on for all the details about the 10 most popular stocks on Robinhood and how they’ve performed for their bullish retail investors over the past two-and-a-half years.
10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood

Our Methodology
To compile the following list of Robinhood most popular stocks, we analyzed the top holdings among Robinhood’s users as of the beginning of each quarter during 2021, as well as their top holdings at the beginning of 2022 and the current top holdings on the platform. We then took the top 10 holdings from each of those six periods and assigned them a points value: ten points for first place, nine for second, and so on, down to one point for tenth.
Finally, we added up the points to create a final list of the top ten most popular stocks on Robinhood over the past two-and-a-half years. We have ranked and ordered those ten stocks based on their stock performance since January 1, 2021 to determine which popular Robinhood stocks delivered the biggest returns for the platform’s users.
Unlike the Robinhood Investor Index, which trails the market since its inception, Insider Monkey has developed several easy-to-follow, market-beating investment strategies. We follow a select group of hedge funds because our leading independent research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns over the long-term.
All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.
10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood
10. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)
Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15
 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 6th (19 points)
 Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -84.4%
 Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of most popular stocks on Robinhood that turned out to be good investments for the platform’s users.
On the opposite end of the spectrum is NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), which has been nothing short of a disaster for Robinhood investors, losing 84.4% of its value since the end of 2020. Nonetheless, it remains one of their top 10 holdings to this day. On the other hand, numerous hedge funds were cutting their losses and abandoning their NIO long positions in Q1, as there was a 38% decline in smart money ownership of NIO.
Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the most prominent funds to sell off its NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stake during Q1, one of 12 stocks the influential money manager is selling in 2023.
While NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) still has intriguing long-term prospects in the EV space, having now expanded its deliveries into Europe, the company has been plagued by supply chain and production problems that have crushed the stock in the near term. The company’s also facing increasing EV competition in its Chinese home market. While 2023 deliveries are up by 22% year-over-year through April, they’ve been sliding in the wrong direction on a monthly basis and are about to come up against tougher comps.
9. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)
Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 5
 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 5th (27 points)
 Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -69.4%
 SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) was also one of the 5 Meme Stocks Redditors are Buying in April of 2022. Unfortunately for both Redditors and Robinhooders alike, the Canadian pot stock has destroyed the value of their investments in a puff of smoke, losing 69% of its value since the end of 2020. Just five hedge funds were long SNDL on March 31, down from seven a quarter earlier and the lowest total since the final quarter of 2020.
SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s struggles are by no means unique among Canadian cannabis companies, which have majorly failed to live up to expectations. The legal Canadian cannabis market simply hasn’t developed anywhere near the extent that was anticipated for a variety of reasons, including consumer dissatisfaction about the quality and cost of legal pot. Industry sales were just $3.7 billion in the first ten months of 2022 according to StatsCan, well below earlier projections that had the industry raking in $7 billion annually by this point.
SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has attempted to mitigate its exposure to the disappointing Canadian cannabis market by expanding into the U.S. market and into the liquor retail space. The latter now accounts for the majority of SNDL’s revenue, which gained an impressive-at-first-blush 1,170% year-over-year in 2022. However that growth was almost entirely through acquisitions and the company continues to remain unprofitable, so it doesn’t look overly promising for SNDL shareholders in the near-term.
8. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)
Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 97
 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 10th (15 points)
 Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -49.8%
 Large-cap stocks dominate most of the remaining list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood, beginning with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney shares soared in late-2020 and looked like a strong bet to continue performing well in the coming years as the pandemic’s impact on its theme parks faded and the subscriber count for its Disney+ streaming platform continued to grow.
That’s been anything but the case however, as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares have lost just over half their value since the end of 2020. Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in the company’s fiscal Q2 and it warned that it could experience further subscriber weakness during the current quarter. That’s not a great sign for the division, which is also losing money, though its losses narrowed in fiscal Q2. Hedge fund ownership of Disney is down by over 50% since the end of 2020.
VGI Partners took advantage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s share weakness in 2022 and believes the company still has substantial earnings power according to the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:
“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.
Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.
Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalise over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)
7. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 244
 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 9th (17 points)
 Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -23.1%
 The ninth-most popular stock among Robinhood investors since the start of 2021 is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has lost 26% of its value during that time. Normally one of the safer picks on the market in recent years, Amazon struggled at various times throughout the pandemic, being unable to meet the initial surge in demand, and then having too much capacity once the demand began waning again.
There was a 14% drop in hedge fund ownership of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q4, with fewer hedge funds now being long AMZN than there’s been since 2019. Nonetheless, the company remains the third-most popular stock among smart money managers as of March 31.
Arch Capital built a new stake Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q1, describing it as a rare opportunity to buy such a special company at a discount, as the fund revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:
“Replacing our Wix investment is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company we are sure you have heard of before. We believe the company’s long-term growth runway, profit potential, and competitive advantages were being vastly underrated in early January when its market cap was well below $1 trillion. We think early January was one of those rare times you could buy a special business like Amazon at a discounted valuation. Our hope is that – if we are right about its competitive advantages in retail and cloud computing – our Amazon stake will end up being a permanent holding in the limited partnership.”
6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)
Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82
 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 2nd (56 points)
 Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -6.3%
 Closing out the first half of our list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), their second-most popular stock overall. It also represents the last of their top ten stock picks that lost money since the start of 2021. Hedge fund ownership of Tesla dipped by 9% in Q1, with John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors and Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments being some of the funds to offload their TSLA stakes.
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are still down during the specified period, but are certainly trending in the right direction this year, having more than doubled in value. Some of the biggest concerns that weighed heavily on the stock in 2022 have generally been resolved, including the state of the EV market (which grew by over 60% in the U.S. last year) as well as Elon Musk’s ability to lead the company (he’s since found a new leader for Twitter, allowing him to focus more on what’s happening at Tesla).
On the other hand, the company’s profitability is coming somewhat into question now following Q1 price cuts that helped drive deliveries growth but also severely hurt the company’s gross margin, which fell by 9.8 percentage points to 19.3% during the quarter.
The Baron Opportunity Fund, which had several managers and analysts attend Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s latest investor day in March, walked away impressed and more bullish on the company than ever, as detailed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

What Is Ford Motor Worth?
Good news, investors! Ford Motor is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $18.10, but it is currently trading at US$14.42 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Ford Motor’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ford Motor's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? Since F is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on F for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy F. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.
So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example, we've found that Ford Motor has 4 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.

Ford (F) Opens First Carbon-Neutral Assembly Plant in Cologne,13-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company F opened Cologne Electric Vehicle Center its first-ever  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-opens-first-carbon-161100589.html,"Ford Motor Company F opened Cologne Electric Vehicle Center, its first-ever carbon-neutral assembly plant in Germany, to manufacture new-generation electric passenger vehicles.

The legendary automaker made a massive $2 billion investment to turn its historic plant in Niehl, Cologne, founded in 1930, into a high-tech production facility. The facility is spread across an area of 125 hectares and is highly efficient. It is equipped with a brand-new production line, battery assembly and state-of-the-art tooling & automation and has an annual production capacity of more than 250,000 EVs.

Ford’s fourth EV, the electric Explorer, a remake of the automaker’s iconic and best-selling Explorer SUV, unveiled in March, will be the first electric vehicle to be produced in the facility, followed by a sports crossover EV.

With the inauguration of a carbon-neutral assembly plant in Germany, Ford has inched closer to its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality across its entire European footprint of facilities, logistics and direct suppliers by 2035.

Bill Ford, executive chairman, Ford, referred to the facility as one of the most efficient and environmentally responsible plants in the entire industry.
A Resilient and Sustainable Manufacturing Hub
Ford’s old plant in Cologne produced more than 18 million cars over a period of 90 years. With the new Cologne EV Center, Ford refined auto manufacturing by implementing advanced technologies to meet customers’ demand for zero-emission mobility, said Martin Sander, general manager of Ford Model e Europe.

The Cologne EV Center is equipped with self-learning machines and autonomous transport systems and implements big data management in real-time to improve the efficiency of the production processes.

Ford is incorporating new cognitive and collaborative robots and augmented reality solutions to support its employees and improve efficiency and data exchange with other plants to share experiences in real-time.
Leading the Charge Toward Carbon Neutrality
In order to deliver on its commitment to building a more sustainable, inclusive and equitable transportation future, Ford will cut down on energy use and emissions in the Cologne EV Center. The energy required to operate the facility is going to be carbon neutral.

The local energy provider to the plant is planning to cut down their operating emissions for heat delivery by nearly 60 percent in 2026. By 2035, the provider is planning to eliminate these emissions.

Sander also said that Ford’s engineers devised the facilities and processes to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental impact, helping the automaker become carbon neutral in Europe and supporting their global decarbonization plan.

Stock Market News for Jun 12 2023,12-Jun-23,Tesla Inc.'s TSLA shares gained 4.1% on Friday after General Motors  Company GM joined Ford Motor Company F in agreeing to use its electric  vehicle (EV)...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-jun-12-133200442.html,"Wall Street ended slightly higher on Friday, led by tech stocks. Even as the recently observed tech boom slowed earlier in the week on apprehension over the sustainability of the artificial-intelligence-led sectoral growth, tech stocks staged a comeback in the session. Investors remained positive that the Fed would announce a rate-hike pause from its June meeting. All three major indexes ended in the green.
How Did the Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.1% or 43.17 points to close at 33,876.78. Seventeen components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 13 ended in negative.
The S&P 500 gained 0.1%, or 4.93 points, to close at 4,298.86. Six of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB), the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) fell 0.8%, 0.6% and 0.6%, respectively, while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) gained 0.5%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 20.62 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 13,259.14.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 1.3% at 13.83. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.84-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.
Tesla Leads a Tech Rebound
Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA shares gained 4.1% on Friday after General Motors Company GM joined Ford Motor Company F in agreeing to use its electric vehicle (EV) charging network. This might make Tesla Superchargers the market leader in the United States. EVs are a fast-growing industry, and this comes as a big boost to the automobile giant led by Elon Musk. This would entail that around 60% of the country’s current EV market would have access to Tesla’s chargers. General Motors’ shares rose 1.1%, while Ford gained 1.2%.
Tesla’s gains stretched its winning streak to 11 consecutive sessions and rang a warning bell for third-party independent charging companies, which fell on the day. These companies now need to up the ante by upgrading their networks to be compatible with Tesla's, during a time when funds available to them are scarce. This might turn out to be a classic case of big fish swallowing small fish.
However, the broad-based tech sector witnessed a rebound from its AI troubles this week on this news. What has also helped is a wide consensus that the Fed would not raise interest rates from its June meeting slated to be held on June 13and 14. Mega-cap growth stocks like tech and consumer discretionaries became the biggest gainers in the session.
Consequently, shares of NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Netflix, Inc. NFLX rose 3.2% and 2.6%, respectively. NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Weekly Roundup
All three most widely followed indexes closed the last week slightly in the green. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq, this was a seventh consecutive winning week. For the S&P 500, this was a fourth straight winning week.
Throughout the week, the upcoming Fed June FOMC meeting dominated the movement in stock markets, with investors hedging their bets on whether the central bank would continue with its rate hikes. Trade was choppy as various financial researchers raised doubts that the AI-led tech recovery, which has helped the sector boom, might not be based on a solid foundation and is exaggerated. All eyes are set this week on what Fed officials have to announce at the conclusion of the Jun 13-14 meeting.
No economic data was released on Friday.

“They developed very quickly, and they’ve developed them in large scale, and now they are exporting,” Ford said in an interview on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS. “They are not here, but they will come here we think at some point and we need to be ready, and we’re getting ready.”
China is poised to become the world’s No. 2 exporter of passenger vehicles, potentially reshaping the global auto industry and shaking up the dominance of its car trading partners and rivals. Overseas shipments of cars made in China have tripled since 2020 to reach more than 2.5 million last year, challenging traditional car exporters such as Germany.
Ford announced this year it will invest $3.5 billion in an electric-vehicle battery plant in Michigan, stirring political controversy by saying it’ll operate with technology and support from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd.
US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg addressed the challenge in a Bloomberg Television interview Sunday, saying the US must take steps to cut into China’s advantage in EV batteries and that building the refining capacity for key materials is “addressable.”
The US has to ensure it is “positioning to have an economically sensible, environmentally sensible and geopolitically stable approach to how we’re going to get these vitally important elements in our economy that are only to grow in importance,” Buttigieg said.
Ford, great-grandson of founder Henry Ford, said he sees an opportunity for Ford engineers to understand the technology.
“All we are doing is licensing the technology,” he said. “That’s really important that our engineers gain that knowledge so we can eventually do it ourselves.”
Ford pushed back on the idea that US-based production will force prices to rise, arguing that making things in America matters and that manufacturing jobs have a multiplier effect that can lead to a stronger economy.
“Once you start to come down the cost curve, and you start climbing up the production curve, the cost will come down, and they’re coming down even as we are sitting here,” Ford said.
China is already deeply involved in electric cars in Europe, where the China-made vehicles sold are mostly electric models from Tesla Inc. Chinese-owned former European brands such as Volvo and MG, and other models like Dacia Spring or the BMW iX3, are also produced exclusively in China.

UPDATE 1-Ford GM see strong US consumer demand for ...,15-Jun-23,... Motors Chief Financial Office Paul Jacobson told a Deutsche Bank  investor conference. ... Yahoo Finance. Tesla (finally) releases updated  Model 3 for North...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-ford-gm-see-strong-175002866.html,"(Updates throughout, with new comments from GM executive)
By Paul Lienert
June 15 (Reuters) - New vehicle demand from U.S. retail and commercial customers is outpacing expectations, two top Detroit auto executives said on Thursday.
Their positive comments underscored an
upbeat report
by the U.S. Commerce Department that showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in May as consumers bought more motor vehicles and a range of other goods.
""If the consumer remains at this strength, we could significantly outperform what we said"" about full-year performance, General Motors Chief Financial Office Paul Jacobson told a Deutsche Bank investor conference.
Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler, in a separate interview at the conference, said ""the consumer is hanging in there"" while noting continued strength and ""pricing power"" in the company's Ford Pro commercial business.
The comments from the two CFOs marked a shift from earlier in the year when many economists and some auto sector executives were bracing for a U.S. recession. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in January forecast a ""serious recession"" and subsequently began slashing prices on the electric car company's vehicles.
Since then, U.S. vehicle sales have stabilized and vehicle production has recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels as supply chain bottlenecks have eased.
Jacobson and Lawler said their companies will keep pushing cost-reduction programs that have already cut thousands of jobs from Ford and GM payrolls. The two companies are under pressure to fund the launch of new electric vehicles that in the near-term will return far less profit than traditional combustion-engine trucks and SUVs.
Ford shares were up 1.1% to $14.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while GM shares rose 1.5% to $37.93 on the NYSE.
Lawler said Ford sees continued strength and growth in its combustion-engine vehicles ""for the next few years"" as it ramps up investment in and production of EVs.
At the same time, the company is focused on slashing engineering and manufacturing costs by 50% on its second-generation EVs, including a successor to the F-150 Lightning that is due in the middle of this decade.
Lawler hinted that Ford may follow Tesla's lead in employing large underbody castings on its next-generation electric vehicles in its broader efforts to trim costs.
Jacobson said GM will not let up on its effort to cut $2 billion out of annual operating costs. As GM faces rising costs for electric vehicles, Jacobson said cost reduction should not be ""a program ... and we go back to the way it was. We have to cultivate continuing improvement on the cost side.""
Both executives said their companies' decisions to join Tesla's EV charging network and embrace its NACS (North American Charging Standard) charging protocol will save money and benefit their EV customers.
Jacobson said GM has an opportunity to partner with Tesla in developing future locations for EV chargers.
Lawler said the adoption of Tesla's charging standard will not require additional capital investment on Ford's part.
Owners of GM and Ford EVs will gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers in North America, starting in early 2024.

General Motors (GM) Invests $632M in Fort Wayne Assembly,15-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-gm-invests-632m-152300308.html,"General Motors Company GM plans to invest $632 million in Fort Wayne Assembly to develop the plant for producing next-generation internal combustion engine (ICE) full-size light-duty trucks. This investment will consolidate General Motors’ industry-leading full-size truck business.

With this announcement, GM’s U.S. manufacturing and parts distribution facility has committed more than $31.6 billion in investment since 2013.

This investment will strengthen GM’s U.S. manufacturing operations, which include over 50 assembly, stamping, propulsion and component plants and parts distribution centers nationwide. It also underscores the automaker’s commitment to providing a strong portfolio of ICE vehicles to its customers in the future.

The Fort Wayne Assembly has manufactured the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500. Both trucks emerged as the best-selling retail full-size light-duty pickups in 2022.

The investment will be utilized to support new conveyors, tooling and equipment in the plant’s body and general assembly areas.

Since 2013, General Motors has announced over $2 billion of investment in Fort Wayne Assembly and Operations and $2.8 billion in Indiana manufacturing operations.

Moreover, BrightDrop, a General Motors startup designed to offer an integrated ecosystem of electric first-to-last-mile products, delivered 50 of its Zevo 600 electric delivery vans to FedEx Express Canada. FedEx has signed a deal with BrightDrop to buy 2,500 vehicles in the coming years. Among those 2,500 vehicles, FedEx has received 400 that are already operational in Southern California.

General Motors has a compelling electric vehicle and ICE portfolio and is in great demand for its quality full-size pickups and full-size SUVs. The auto giant targets EV revenues of more than $50 billion by 2025

Another  major...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-profitable-car-companies-124926108.html,"In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 most profitable car companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the statistics and economic impact of the automobile manufacturing sector, effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage on vehicle manufacturing and the future outlook of the sector and go directly to 5 Most Profitable Car Companies in the World. 
The automobile manufacturing sector is one of the largest industries worldwide. Often, a country’s automotive sector is a reflection of its broader economic condition. According to ACEA, 85.4 million motor vehicles were produced around the world in 2022, an increase of 5.7% from 2021. 
The automotive industry contributes around 3% to the global GDP and this share is even higher in emerging markets like India and China, where the auto sector accounts for 7% of GDP. The industry employs over 4 million people worldwide directly and even more indirectly through the businesses and industries that it supports. The Center for Automotive Research has revealed that around 4.5% of all U.S. jobs are supported by the country’s auto industry and people working in these jobs collectively earn over $500 billion annually in compensation and contribute over $70 billion in tax revenues. 
Largest Automobile Manufacturer Country in the World
China is the largest automobile manufacturing country in the world. The Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers has revealed that the country's carmakers produced 27 million vehicles in 2022, up by 3% from 2021, while sales increased by 2.1% to 26.86 million units. The U.S. comes in at second, with 14.9 million vehicles produced in 2022.
Car Company that Sells the Most Cars in the World
Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) retained its title as the world's top-selling  automaker in 2022. The company reported sales of over 10 million vehicles worldwide in 2022. The Japanese manufacturer, which is also one of the most profitable car companies in the world, said that strong demand in Asia and an increase in production capacity, along with optimisation in Asia and North America helped it boost global production by 5% in 2022. The Volkswagen Group ranked second, with 8.3 million vehicles sold in 2022.
When it comes to the electric vehicles market, the Chinese auto manufacturer BYD Auto led the pack with over 1.8 million EV units sold in 2022. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) came in at second with 1.3 million EVs sold worldwide. 
The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the global auto manufacturing sector, disrupting its supply chains and operation activities. When the Chinese cities were put into lockdown, global car manufacturers struggled with the shortage of parts to keep their industry engines running. Eventually, as the virus spread to other countries, production in Japan, the U.S. and several other large markets came to a complete halt due to social-distancing practices. An example of this is Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which reported an 18.4% decline in its sales in 2020, compared to the previous year. 
Another major problem that the automotive sector has been faced with is the global semiconductor chip shortage. In conventional automobiles, chips process information in various vehicle subsystems that improve a vehicle’s efficiency and make driving safer. According to a study by the United States International Trade Commission, conventional vehicles had approximately $330 worth of chips in 2019 and this number has risen even further now. Additionally, the adoption of electric vehicles, with their more complicated systems, has raised the demand for semiconductor chips even higher. 
The global semiconductor industry has struggled to keep up with this rising demand, mainly due to Covid-19 disruptions, trade action uncertainty and accelerated digital transformation. A report by Techwire Asia has revealed that the shortage of semiconductors had caused vehicle manufacturing lead times to increase from an average 3 to 4 months, to an average of 10 to 12 months. Automakers around the world lost an estimated $210 billion in revenue in 2021 due to the chip shortage. 
However, the easing of Covid-19 restrictions globally boosted automobile sales, as consumers who had put off purchases during lockdowns finally started buying again, which has helped outweigh the effects of the semiconductor shortage. According to Market Research Future, the global automotive industry is projected to reach $6 tillion by 2030, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 6.9%.

Toyota investors are calling for the board chair's ouster over ...,13-Jun-23,... companies like Ford and General Motors and newcomers like Tesla or  China's BYD. ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto  · Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-investors-calling-board-chair-100028942.html,"One of the titans of corporate Japan is facing unhappy shareholders.
Toyota Motor Corporation's current board chairman, Akio Toyoda, served as president and CEO for almost 14 years, only stepping down earlier this year. Under Toyoda’s leadership, Toyota rose to be the world’s largest automaker, first achieving that status in 2020.
But when shareholders convene on Wednesday morning Japan time, several of Toyota’s shareholders, like the New York City’s comptroller’s office (who manages the city's pension fund) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), will support a measure to oust Toyoda—who is the grandson of the company’s founder—from the board.
The reason: Toyota—and Toyoda’s—slow embrace of electric cars. While the company still leads in selling hybrid cars, it’s only now playing catch-up when it comes to making pure electric vehicles, both to established companies like Ford and General Motors and newcomers like Tesla or China’s BYD.
“Toyota is failing to lean, like its peers, into a timely transition to an electric fleet,” Brad Lander, New York City comptroller, told the Wall Street Journal.
The two pension funds also argue the company’s board does not have enough independent directors, and both have voted for a separate resolution calling for greater disclosure of the company’s lobbying on climate change.
While the measure is unlikely to succeed, the Wall Street Journal notes that shareholder revolts, even minor ones, are rare in Japanese corporate culture. Toyoda won renomination to the board last year with 96% of the vote.
“Even in this difficult business environment, Chairman of the Board Akio Toyoda has been strengthening our competitiveness from a long-term perspective,” a company spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal.
Toyota and electric cars
Unlike his fellow executives, like Ford’s Jim Farley or General Motors’s Mary Barra, let alone Tesla’s Elon Musk, Toyoda was a vocal skeptic of electric cars in his final months as Toyota’s CEO.
Last December, Toyoda complained that public pressure was stopping executives, who he called a “silent majority,” from speaking honestly about electric cars “as a single option.”
“They think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly,” he suggested.
Then, in January, Toyota Motors announced that Toyoda would be stepping down as the company’s president, in favor of Koji Sato, then-head of the company’s Lexus subsidiary. “I am an old fashioned person in regards to digitalization, electric vehicles, and connected cars,” Toyoda said at the time.
Sato took over as president in April, and quickly announced the carmaker would quickly expand its offering of electric cars, releasing 10 new models by 2026.
Yet investors worry that Toyota still isn’t taking the transition to electric vehicles seriously, noting that the company still hasn’t given a firm date for when it might have an all-electric fleet. A slow embrace of electric cars also means the company can’t capture growing demand for EVs in large markets like China, and also misses out from new subsidies being offered by both the U.S. and the European Union.
“Toyota’s EV strategy is simply not looking attractive,” Anders Schelde, chief investment officer of AkademikerPension, a Danish fund, told the Wall Street Journal.
Crisis of confidence
Worries about Toyota’s EV strategy are part of a broader crisis of confidence in the Japanese auto industry.
Earlier this year, China overtook Japan as the world’s largest exporter of cars, in part due to a surge of exported EVs made in the country. Tesla produces half its cars in Shanghai, while Shenzhen-based BYD is also exploring export opportunities.
Japanese brands are also losing ground in the domestic Chinese market, as consumers flock to electric cars, whether produced by local companies or by Tesla.
It’s not just Japanese automakers that are freaking out about China. European auto executives are worried too: Chinese-made electric cars could capture 15% of the European market by 2025, up from less than 10% last year, KPMG China chief economist Kevin Kang suggested to the South China Morning Post. 
The “biggest danger” for EV prices are “the Chinese coming in,” said Peugeot CEO Linda Jackson at a Financial Times conference in May.
“They are coming in with quite competitive prices and with very good vehicles,” she said.

For a decade, Toyota sat idly while Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) sparked the EV revolution that is now in full swing. But, we the new CEO at the helm, Toyota is finally waking up to the EV reality.
A Battery Breakthrough
Without offering any technical details Toyota announced this week it achieved a breakthrough in battery technology. Toyota announced it had achieved a “breakthrough” in battery technology, claiming that this solid state batteries will both improve the driving range to 900 miles as well as cut the costs of EVs. Although Toyota is certainly making a strategic pivot , the provided EV roadmap did not include the costs and investment details.
Ford Has Filed A Roof-Mounted Backup EV Battery System
Lately, Ford Motors (NYSE: F) has been showing it is getting creative. It joined Tesla’s team to benefit from its supercharging network. Last week, it filed for a patent that aims to give drivers more juice while off the grid. The patent in question is a removable backup battery that can be placed on the roof of the EV and become a priceless remote power source during off-roading and camping. Ford says that the backup battery will also be sold as an independent item, as well as leased and rented. But with the current EV batteries weighing about 1,000 lbs, the concept can face issues on its realization pathway.
Worksport’s Revolutionary Technology Is Coming To Power Pickups, Campsites And Remote Locations
Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) has two ground-breaking products in store. The first is the SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover, also the first of its kind, that will significantly enhance the power of any pickup, with the first being Hyundai’s Santa Cruz. The second is the COR on-the-go power system. Under the leadership of Dr. Rafael Olivera, this ground-breaking battery power generation has been recently updated in terms of design and efficiency as Worksport proudly announced last week that its interface has been enhanced and power capacity expanded from 2kW to 3kW. What is truly remarkable is that Worksport achieved to increase the output by 50% without altering the size of the battery and while maintain the estimated retail price as well as protecting its margins. In its submitted patent, Ford did not brag about boosting the power density in its backup battery.
All in all, SOLIS and COR are a portable power team that promise the change the face of not only the pickup and the EV world, but also the world of transportation. On June 6th, Worksport already launched its soft folding tonneau cover, SC4 PRO and is making significant progress towards kicking off its hard-folding tonneau covers production line at its newest facility in New York. This innovative company is marching steadfast in its pursuit of industry leadership.
Toyota has a lot of work to do if wants to win the EV game
All in all, Toyota entered the EV game late and is quite behind. Although this doesn’t mean it still can’t pull off a victory, as Tesla is the written example that anything is possible, companies such as Worksport certainly raised the bar in terms what it has to accomplish.

Japanese automaker Toyota said it will invest $328 million to produce a new hybrid model of its popular Tacoma pickup truck in Mexico.
The company plans to expand its factory in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato, where Toyota already produces its Tacoma truck line for the North American market.
“Toyota has informed us of an investment of $328 million in their Guanajuato plant for the adaptation of their lines to produce a new generation of Tacoma for the North American market, which will be hybrid electric,” Diego Sinhue Rodriguez Vallejo, governor of the Mexican state of Guanajuato, posted on Twitter.
Rodriguez Vallejo was meeting with Toyota officials during a tour of Japan last week.
“We will start preparing the new generation of Tacomas in Guanajuato and we are very, very excited that this plant is going to play a very important role in Toyota’s manufacturing in North America,” said Luis Lozano, president of Toyota Mexico.
The expansion will add 2,500 jobs to the Guanajuato factory, which already employs about 1,700 workers.
The Tacoma hybrid is set to begin production and go on sale by the end of the year.
Toyota’s plant in Guanajuato opened in December 2019, with capacity to produce up to 100,000 Tacomas annually. Over the past three years, Toyota has invested $1.2 billion in the plant.
The Guanajuato plant is about 600 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border crossing at Laredo, Texas.
Mexico is developing into a key manufacturing hub for electric and hybrid vehicles, which are mainly exported to the United States.
General Motors, Ford Motor Co., BMW and Audi are already producing EVs in the country or plan to, while Tesla is building a $5 billion electric vehicle factory in the Mexican city of Monterrey.

All 737-Max 9 jets to remain  grounded until Boeing sends...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-ford-motor-130011240.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +24%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 37.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of -32.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.74 points to a change of -7.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.71 indicates a change of -1.7% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $39.64 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.69 billion and $159.12 billion estimates indicate +6.5% and +0.3% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $39.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.7%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.38 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +57.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-jim-farley-dismisses-172711975.html,"Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley Jr. dismissed concerns that the Tesla Inc. Cybertruck could pose a threat to Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, during June 20 interview with CNBC.

""The reality is, America loves an underdog — and we are the market leader for EV [electric vehicle] trucks and vans, and we know those customers better than anyone,"" Farley said. ""And if [Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk] wants to design a Cybertruck for Silicon Valley people, fine.""
But with the launch of the Cybertruck approaching, the dynamics of the pickup truck market may soon challenge Farley's words.
The Cybertruck marks Tesla's entry into the electric pickup truck segment, an area previously dominated by Ford with its F-150. Last year, Ford delivered over 13,000 electric F-150 trucks, showcasing the company’s commitment to electrification. While Tesla has been a dominant force in the overall electric vehicle market, the pickup truck market presents a significant opportunity for growth because of its lucrative nature.
Farley further expressed his views on the Cybertruck, describing it as ""like a cool high-end product parked in front of a hotel."" He emphasized that Ford's focus is on making trucks for ""real people who do real work,"" implying that the Cybertruck caters more to the tech-savvy demographic of Silicon Valley than to the traditional pickup truck customer base.
While Tesla has not yet disclosed official pricing for the Cybertruck, estimates suggest it could start around $50,000, making it competitively priced against Ford's F-150 Lightning, which starts at around $60,000. But pricing is just one aspect of the overall package, and factors like functionality, reliability and customer preferences will ultimately determine the success of each vehicle.

Where Tesla particularly stands out is through its marketing efforts. Tesla maintains a strict position on not spending money on advertising but that hasn’t stopped incredible demand for their vehicles. But Ford has to spend billions per year on advertising just to maintain the status quo. As the advertising market becomes increasingly complex, with social media and influencers becoming more important and television slowing down in spend. Other solutions like Thumzup, a startup democratizing influencer marketing, continue to grow in prominence as well.
Some reports suggest potential design flaws in the Cybertruck, including issues with suspension, handling and braking. The reports are based on leaked information, and the final product may undergo changes and improvements before production and delivery begin.
Despite Farley's dismissive tone toward the Cybertruck, Ford recently announced its plans to adopt Tesla's charging standard and use a portion of Tesla's Supercharging network. This move was seen as a strategic decision to enhance charging access for Ford customers and leverage Tesla's charging infrastructure. Farley clarified that the partnership was driven by the aim of providing better services to customers and did not hesitate to embrace it.
As the launch of the Cybertruck draws closer, the competition between Tesla and Ford in the electric pickup truck market is set to intensify. The Cybertruck's futuristic design and strong preorder numbers indicate significant interest from consumers. Ford's established position in the pickup truck market and its understanding of the needs of traditional truck owners could give it an edge.
Only time will tell whether Farley's words will stand the test of competition and customer satisfaction.

Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power  gaming and AI...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-preparing-round-layoffs-us-213357398.html,"(Reuters) - Ford Motor is preparing for a new round of layoffs for its salaried workers in the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company in March last year announced plans to reduce structural costs of up to $3 billion at its gas-powered vehicle unit. In August, Ford said it would cut a total of 3,000 salaried and contract jobs, mostly in North America and India.
According to the WSJ report, the new round of layoffs is expected to affect employees at the Detroit automaker's gas, electric-vehicle and software divisions, but the number of cuts could not be learned.
Ford did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The automaker's latest effort to streamline its operations comes after peers Stellantis NV and General Motors said they were offering employee buyouts.
Price hikes and strong demand for new vehicles have helped automakers counter some inflationary headwinds, though higher costs of raw material remain a challenge.
Automakers have also been trying to control costs at their expensive-to-run electric vehicle businesses, a focus area for the industry as environmental-friendly vehicles drift into the mainstream.

Ford-SK venture to get $9.2 billion US loan for battery plants,22-Jun-23,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department plans to lend up to $9.2  billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor ...

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department plans to lend up to $9.2 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor and South Korea's SK On to help it build three battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, the biggest-ever award from the government program.
The conditional commitment for the low-cost government loan for the BlueOval SK joint venture comes from the government's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program.
SK is a unit of South Korea's SK Innovation. The joint venture is building two battery manufacturing plants in Kentucky and one in Tennessee capable of collectively producing more than 120 gigawatt hours annually, the Energy Department said.
Jigar Shah, head of the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, said in an interview its goal ""is to have people choose to put these supply chains here in the United States, not in other countries, and to do them faster and more confidently here.""
Ford and SK announced in 2021 they would invest $11.4 billion to build a F-150 electric vehicle (EV) assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States with Ford investing $7 billion. Ford shares were up 1.2% in afternoon trading.
This is the sixth loan for battery supply chain projects from the ATVM program.
PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION
The project is expected to create 5,000 construction jobs in Tennessee and Kentucky, and 7,500 operations jobs once the plants are up and running.
""Major technology transitions have always been accelerated by collaboration between the public and private sectors,"" said Ford Treasurer Dave Webb.
BlueOval SK CEO Robert Rhee said the loan will be used to ""strengthen critical domestic supply chains, and produce high-quality batteries for future Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles.""
The $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act approved in August also creates a new $45 per kilowatt battery production tax credit. Ford CEO Jim Farley said in October that from 2023 to 2026, ""we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion.""
The loan will fund two battery projects in Republican-leaning states. Many Republicans in Congress have criticized the Biden administration's efforts to boost battery-powered vehicles and battery production.
Last year, the department awarded a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution $2.5 billion to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities. The loan to Ultium Cells LLC is for facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.
In September 2009, Ford was awarded a $5.9 billion low-cost government loan from the same program, an important source of liquidity in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It completed its payments last year, after deferring some in 2020.
Ford announced in February a separate deal to spend $3.5 billion to use technology from Chinese battery company CATL to build a battery plant in Michigan. That plan has faced criticism from some Republicans.
Tesla received a $465 million loan in 2010 from the program that allowed it to open a plant in Fremont, California, and build the Model S electric car. It repaid the loan in 2013.

The move, Rivian claimed, would give customers access to the biggest U.S. charging network, reported Reuters.
The customers will be able to access 12,000 Tesla Superchargers with adapters in the United States and Canada as early as spring 2024.
The company will also make a Tesla-style charging port standard in its vehicles from 2025.
Tesla’s Superchargers constitute about 60% of the total fast chargers available in the U.S.

However, Rivian, which makes the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV, said it would continue to expand its own charging network.
Tesla has struck deals in recent weeks with automotive giants, including Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) to use its charging technology.
By opening its charging network to electric vehicles from other brands, Tesla stands to gain some of the $7.5 billion in subsidies the Biden administration has approved to boost charging infrastructure in the U.S.

Used Car Market  - Market Segmentation
This report extensively covers market segmentation by vehicle type (compact car, SUV, and mid-size), channel (organized and unorganized), and geography (APAC, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and South America).
The used car industry share growth by the compact car segment will be significant during the forecast period. Compact cars are a popular choice for personal mobility due to their increasing specifications, fuel efficiency, and ease of driving in congested areas. They also emit fewer harmful gases than larger cars, making them a more environmentally friendly option. The global compact car market is driven by the growing demand for these vehicles in emerging markets, such as India. The improving quality of used cars offered by the organized sector is also contributing to the growth of the market. These factors will drive the demand for used cars during the forecast period.
Market Dynamics:
Used Car Market - Key Drivers
The declining ownership cycle of vehicles among urban consumers in emerging countries is notably driving the pre-owned car market growth. The ownership duration of cars is shortening due to new technological advances in the automotive industry. These advances attract customers to buy new cars, even if their current cars are still in good condition. However, financial constraints often force customers to sell their existing cars to used car dealers or online used car portals. The easy availability of bank loans also facilitates the financing for new car purchases. The prices of used cars are determined by a number of factors, including the number of years the vehicle was driven, the distance driven, and the number of damages caused due to accidents and other faults. In India, a used car having no major faults can fetch up to 70% of its actual price after one year of ownership and about 62% of its actual price after three years of ownership Such convincing values encourage car owners to sell their cars at the earliest convenience to get back most of the car value. Hence, these factors will drive market growth during the forecast period.
Major Trends:
Growing demand for car subscription services is an emerging trend in the pre-owned car market. Car subscription is an alternative to owning or leasing a vehicle. It allows consumers to use a car for an all-inclusive monthly fee, which includes roadside assistance, insurance, and maintenance. Subscribers can also change cars at a notice of a few days. Several auto manufacturers offer car subscription services in major regions across the globe. For instance, Volvo's car subscription service is called Care by Volvo. Hyundai Motor Co. and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. also offer car subscription services. Additionally, consumers who find high-priced cars unaffordable due to their high cost of ownership or leasing prefer such car subscription services to get the experience of driving a luxury car. These services have augmented the demand for these cars.. Therefore, these factors will drive the market during the forecast period
Key Challenges:
The increase in the number of on-demand taxi operators is a major challenge impeding the pre-owned car market. On-demand taxi services have emerged as a convenient alternative to purchasing a new car, especially for those who are financially constrained. These services provide a convenient and comfortable means of transportation, as well as save time and energy on finding parking. Additionally, on-demand taxi operators do not need to maintain a fleet of cars, but rather can simply be available to potential customers through mobile applications. This makes the business model more flexible and easier to manage than self-drive car rental companies. On-demand taxi operators are also expanding their services to include on-demand bike taxis, which can tap into a wider range of customer segments. Major on-demand taxi operators like Uber and Ola Cabs also invest heavily in advertising across multiple mediums, such as digital, television, and print, to increase their brand awareness. Hence, the above-mentioned factors will hinder the global market growth during the forecast period.

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers will urge the CEOs of Ford Motor and General Motors to shrink reliance on China auto parts, particularly electric vehicle batteries, sources told Reuters on Monday.
Four lawmakers who are part of the House of Representatives China Select Committee will travel to Detroit Tuesday to meet with Ford's Jim Farley and GM's Mary Barra, the sources said.
Republicans Mike Gallagher and John Moolenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Haley Stevens also plan to meet with executives from auto suppliers including BorgWarner, Continental, Bosch, Tenneco and battery startup Our Next Energy (ONE).
The focus on Chinese auto parts comes soon after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a rare visit to Beijing and hours of meetings failed to produce any major breakthroughs. Ford said Monday it ""shares the committee’s goals of strengthening American competitiveness and establishing EV supply chains in the U.S., and in our meeting tomorrow we plan to share how we’re doing just that.""
GM declined to comment on the meeting.
Gallagher, who chairs the China committee, in April raised concerns about Tesla's dependency on China, after the company revealed plans to open a Megapack battery factory in Shanghai.
The $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed by President Joe Biden in August aims to wean U.S. EV production from Chinese supply chains by imposing new conditions on EV tax credits. The new tax credit rules restrict eligibility to only North American assembled vehicles and set battery sourcing rules.
Ford's deal announced in February to use technology from Chinese battery company CATL as part of the automaker's plan to spend $3.5 billion to build a battery plant in Michigan has drawn criticism from some lawmakers.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio has asked the Biden administration to block EV tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology.
Ford said previously ""making those batteries here at home is much better than continuing to rely exclusively on foreign imports, like other auto companies do.""
Bloomberg News first reported the planned meetings.

The shift in industry preference can be attributed to the advantageous design of Tesla's NACS, which is notably more compact and lighter than its CCS counterpart, rendering it more user-friendly for motorists.The sweeping shift toward Tesla's NACS port signifies a pivotal moment in the EV charging landscape. (EV Charging Space in for a Paradigm Shift With Tesla's NACS)
On the news front, U.S. auto biggie Ford F accelerated EV innovation with the launch of its Cologne EV Center in Germany, driving sustainable mobility solutions and solidifying its position in the global EV revolution. In an ambitious shift, Japan’s auto giant Toyota TM has unveiled new strategies to become a frontrunner in the EV market. Toyota revealed an extensive plan outlining new technology deployment and radical factory redesigns, clearly indicating the company's resolve to secure a larger slice of the rapidly expanding battery EV market.
Amid the intensifying EV price war and efforts to boost sales, China EV maker NIO Inc. NIO cut the cost of all its models by 30,000 yuan ($4,200) and terminated free battery swapping services for new buyers. Finally, Nikola Corporation’s NKLA strategic moves to drive business optimization were also in focus as it gears up for the launch of its hydrogen fuel cell electric truck, marking a significant step toward sustainable transportation.
F and NKLA currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively. TSLA, TM and NIO carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Last Week’s Top Stories
1. Nio lowered prices across all its models, including its revamped ES8 and ES6 SUVs (sports utility vehicles), effective Jun 12, 2023, amid a deepening EV price war in the country. Additionally, the company is encountering growing difficulties attributed to widening financial losses and lackluster sales. In a bid to rev up demand for its offerings, NIO announced a price cut of 30,000 yuan ($4,200) across all its models. With this, the price of Nio’s cheapest model comes down to 228,000 yuan ($32,000).
Starting this year, EV behemoth Tesla slashed the prices of its models quite a few times in China and elsewhere, registering a record number of quarterly deliveries. The price cut by Tesla propelled local automakers in China to undercut prices to retain their market share. Over 40 automobile brands, including BYD Ltd. and Volkswagen, have entered a price competition initiated by Tesla in China this year. At first, Nio refused to enter the price war but the widening loss left the EV maker with no choice. Nio also announced ending its free battery swapping services for new buyers.
2. In a significant step toward their electrification goals, Ford unveiled its Cologne EV Center in Germany. This state-of-the-art facility signifies Ford's commitment to the development of green vehicles and the advancement of sustainable mobility solutions. The Cologne EV Center, located at Ford's existing manufacturing site, will serve as a hub for the company's EV efforts in Europe. This significant milestone underlines Ford's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality across its entire European footprint of facilities, logistics and direct suppliers by 2035.
The legendary automaker made a massive $2 billion investment to turn its historic plant in Cologne, founded in 1930, into a high-tech production facility. The facility is spread across an area of 125 hectares and is highly efficient. It is equipped with a brand-new production line, battery assembly and state-of-the-art tooling & automation and has an annual production capacity of more than 250,000 EVs. Ford’s fourth EV, the electric Explorer, a remake of the automaker’s iconic and best-selling Explorer SUV, unveiled in March, will be the first electric vehicle to be produced in the facility, followed by a sports crossover EV.
3. With the recent change in leadership from Akio Toyoda to Koji Sato, Toyota is demonstrating a newfound commitment to EVs. Toyota plans to introduce a full lineup of electric Toyota and Lexus cars by 2026.It claims to have achieved a ""breakthrough"" in solid-state battery technology. It plans to commercialize this technology from 2027 to 2028, aiming for a 20% improvement in the cruising range compared to current batteries. Moreover, Japan’s government has pledged to provide up to $841 million in subsidies. The funds will bolster the automaker's investment in the domestic production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, the lifeblood of the future of mobility.
Toyota’s BEV Factory aims to produce EVs with a driving range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), which is a significant improvement over competitors like Tesla, whose Model 3 has a range of approximately 430 to 570 kilometers. The ambitious target is to produce about 1.7 million vehicles by 2030. Toyota aims to achieve sales of 1.5 million all-electric vehicles per year by 2026, and 3.5 million units annually by 2030. On the production front, the company is adopting Giga casting, an innovative assembly-line automation technology introduced by Tesla
4. Nikola, a leader in zero-emissions transportation and energy solutions, provided an update on its business optimization efforts. The company expects its annual cash usage to decrease to under $400 million by 2024 through the reorganization of its workforce and the elimination of non-essential spending. Nikola is focusing on North America, zero-emission truck production, and its HYLA hydrogen business, with the battery-electric truck already performing well in the marketplace and the launch of the hydrogen fuel cell electric truck scheduled for the third quarter.
In order to optimize operations, Nikola is realigning its cost structure, localizing the supply chain, and prioritizing a capital-efficient approach for its HYLA hydrogen energy infrastructure business. The company has also formed a strategic partnership with Voltera to develop up to 50 hydrogen stations over the next five years. Furthermore, Nikola is streamlining its organizational structure and reducing its headcount, which is expected to decrease personnel-related cash spend by over $50 million annually. These measures are aimed at creating a sustainable structure that aligns with the company's focus areas and positions it for future growth.

Hyundai to consider joining Tesla's North American charging ...,20-Jun-23,Tesla opening its charging network to electric vehicles from other brands  is a condition for the company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners ·  Personal Finance...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyundai-consider-joining-teslas-north-083242532.html,"SEOUL, June 20 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor will consider making its vehicles more readily compatible with the charging standard Tesla is pushing for in North America, the South Korean automaker's CEO said on Tuesday.
Tesla's Superchargers make up about 60% of available U.S. fast chargers and Ford and General Motors have in recent weeks struck deals with Tesla to use its charging technology, now dubbed the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
Jaehoon Chang, who is also Hyundai's president, said the company would consider joining the alliance of automakers shifting to Tesla's standard, but that it would have to determine that was in the interest of its customers.
One issue, he said, is that Tesla's current network of Superchargers does not allow for the faster charging Hyundai's electric vehicles can achieve on other chargers.
""That's what we will look into from the customer's perspective,"" Chang told analysts at the automaker's investor day.
Hyundai's new electric cars, including the Ioniq 5, use an 800-volt electrical architecture to allow for faster charging, while Tesla's Superchargers operate at a lower voltage.

Chang said Hyundai would consult with Tesla to see whether it could make adjustments to its charging system for Hyundai customers so they could charge faster.
Tesla opening its charging network to electric vehicles from other brands is a condition for the company to qualify for some of the $7.5 billion in subsidies the Biden administration has provided to speed the deployment of chargers in the U.S.
The U.S carmaker also stands to profit from selling power to a bigger group of electric vehicle drivers. Tesla shares are up more than 40% since late May when it announced its deal with Ford.

Increasing deployment of charging stations across the country is expected to propel the industry’s progress. Further, the robust demand for low emission vehicles is expected to propel the adoption of the vehicles. In addition, the rising government investments in the development of low emission alternatives to fuel vehicles are expected to enhance the India electric vehicle market share during the upcoming years.
COVID-19 Impact-
Temporary Halt in Manufacturing Activities Impede Market Growth
A considerable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed on India electric vehicle market.

Ford Motor Company (F) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You ...,28-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company (F) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know ...  Investors might want to bet on Ford Motor Company (F) as it has been  recently upgraded to...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-upgraded-160007066.html,"Investors might want to bet on Ford Motor Company (F), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.
Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ford Motor Company basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.
Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Ford Motor Company imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ford Motor Company
For the fiscal year ending December 2023, this company is expected to earn $1.74 per share, which is a change of -7.5% from the year-ago reported number.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ford Motor Company. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 15.6%.
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Ford Motor Company to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a market darling. After surging 137% year to date, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a market cap of over $800 billion — more than 13 times that of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F).
But according to CNBC's Jim Cramer, you'd be missing out if you ignore the Detroit-based automaker.
Cramer recently visited Ford's headquarters and was impressed by what he saw.
""From what I saw today with my own eyes and what I’ve heard from CEO Jim Farley, I think American ingenuity and innovation here at Ford are undervalued, undervalued versus Tesla and possibly even everything else made in America,"" he said.
The Mad Money host believes that there's ""real value"" in Ford.

Managing Risk And Reward
Ford shares have climbed 28% in 2023 but are still down quite a bit from last year's high.
Cramer sees a glorious revival on the horizon.
""If I'm right about Ford, this stock could get back to its high of $25, where it was in January 2022,"" he said.
Considering that Ford shares currently trade at $14.95, the price target implies a potential upside of 67%.
When it comes to investing, the focus is not solely on chasing substantial gains but also on effectively managing the downside when things don't go your way. And on that front, Cramer has good news.
""But if I’m wrong, I have to tell you, I think the downside — I'm calling it minimal,"" he said.
And that means if he had to choose between Ford and the hottest automotive stock in the market, the answer is obvious.
""Investing is all about managing risk and reward. At these prices, I'll take Ford over Tesla any day,"" Cramer said. ""And believe me, I like both.""
What's Holding Ford Back
The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rates substantially to tame inflation. And that has consequences for the automotive industry.
In 2022 — a year that the Fed announced seven rate hikes — U.S. auto sales totaled 13.7 million vehicles, marking the lowest level since 2011.
""Remember, most cars and trucks are bought on credit, and the cost of financing keeps soaring,"" Cramer said.
He then asked, ""At what point does it get high enough to price out most buyers, especially the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the bedrock customer base for the F-150 and the wildly popular F-150 Lightning?""
Even though the cost of financing vehicles has gone up, Ford's F-Series pickup remains an American favorite. In 2022, F-Series sales totaled 653,957 trucks, making it the best-selling truck in the country for 46 consecutive years and the best-selling vehicle for 41 years.
That number still marked a nearly 10% drop from the 726,004 F-Series trucks Ford sold in 2021.
Cramer's Take On Housing
Since the Fed is committed to fighting inflation, many are wondering when rates can finally go back down.
Cramer suggests that ""the biggest sticking point with the Fed"" is the ""ever-rising price of housing.""
The problem has to do with an imbalance between supply and demand.
""We have a true shortage of houses in this country — perhaps as many as 2 to 4 million,"" he said.
While housing remains expensive in America, new companies have innovated ways for people to earn passive income in the real estate market. Here's how to invest in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.
The U.S. Census Bureau reported that there were 1.63 million housing starts in May, up from 1.34 million in April.
Cramer says that if homebuilders can ""keep that up, maybe we can finally put a dent in housing inflation.""
""If we get a combination of high unemployment and cheaper housing, maybe the Fed can stop tightening without having to obliterate the entire economy,"" he added.

Ford (F) to Reduce Headcount in the United States and Canada,27-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Allison Transmission  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-reduce-headcount-united-150400572.html,"Ford Motor Company F prepares to trim its workforce as part of its restructuring process. The layoffs will mostly affect engineering jobs in the United States and Canada. This round of layoff is expected to affect all of Ford’s business units, including Ford Blue, Model e and Ford Pro.

A company spokesperson declined to disclose the number of employees that will be affected by the layoff. In a recent quarterly filing, the legendary automaker mentioned that for the full year 2023, it expects to incur a total cost of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, “primarily attributable to employee separations and supplier settlements.” In 2021 and 2022, the total cost incurred for the same was $2 billion and $608 million, respectively.

In August 2022, the automaker laid off 3,000 employees in North America and in February 2023, it announced cutting off 3,800 jobs in Europe. In its first quarterly filing, the automaker suggested that it may take additional restructuring action to attain sustainable profitability.

When compared with its competitors, Ford has a nearly $7 billion cost disadvantage that it aims to address through improved efficiency and job cuts. The Ford+ plan plays a vital role in the company’s staffing arrangements.

In an interview, Jim Farley, CEO Ford, said that it takes the company 25% more engineers to perform the same work as its competitors and the company can’t afford to be 25% inefficient.

According to a public filing, last year, Ford’s worldwide employee count dropped by 10,000 to 173,000.

Per the company’s email, the affected employees will get severance pay, benefits and support to find new career opportunities.

Tesla beats second-quarter delivery estimates as price cuts ...,02-Jul-23,Meanwhile the electric-vehicle pioneer has notched up a series of wins in  the EV fast-charging space with companies such as Ford Motor and General  Motors as...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-beats-second-quarter-delivery-160854349.html,"(Reuters) -Tesla Inc on Sunday said it delivered a record number of vehicles in the second quarter, topping market estimates as price cuts and U.S. federal credits helped make its electric vehicles more affordable.
The Elon Musk-led company handed 466,140 vehicles in the April to June period, up 10% from the preceding quarter, and 83% higher from a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected Tesla to deliver 445,000 cars, according to nine analysts polled by Refinitiv, with the lowest estimate at 439,875 and highest at 450,000.
The world's most valuable automaker produced 13,560 more vehicles than it delivered in the second quarter, although the gap has narrowed from 17,933 the first quarter.
""The price cuts was a smart poker move for Tesla and paying major dividends in the field especially for the China market,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.
Tesla is expected to hit record sales in China, its second-largest market after North America, despite stiff competition from market leader BYD.
""We believe margins will trough the next few quarters,"" Ives added.
Tesla has cut prices starting in China since late last year, eroding its first-quarter margins. Tesla boss Elon Musk in April doubled down on the price war, saying the electric vehicle (EV) maker would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy and rising competition.
It has since increased discounts across all of its line-ups, in a move seen to reduce inventory, while making all of its Model 3s eligible for full federal credits of $7,500 starting in June in the United States.
The company delivered 446,915 Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicle, as well as 19,225 of its Model S and Model X premium vehicles.
Meanwhile, the electric-vehicle pioneer has notched up a series of wins in the EV fast-charging space with companies such as Ford Motor and General Motors, as well as fast-charging equipment makers agreeing to adopt the firm's North American Charging Standard (NACS).

Tesla Is Another Step Closer To Dominating The Charging ...,29-Jun-23,Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) have said  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-another-step-closer-dominating-174726765.html,"Volvo Cars is the latest EV maker to embrace Tesla’s North American charging standard in what seems to be an identical agreement as those previously made by General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) earlier this month. Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) have said they are considering following their footseps, but the Swedish automaker is the first European EV maker to formally commit to the NACS charging standard for its EVs sold in North America. These deals could give Elon Musk control of the charging infrastructure and the EV game as a whole, considering that this is the critical barrier to global EV adoption.
Focus On The Customer
General Motors CEO Mary Barra described the advantages of the GM’s decision to adopt Tesla’s NACS as its customers will gain access to 13,000 most efficient chargers in the US. This decision will also help GM save $400 million.
With EVs of above four automakers integrating Tesla’s NACS as of 2025, it is official that the efforts by the Biden administration to make the Combined Charging System (CCS) the dominant charging standard in the United States have failed, although Tesla’s technology is yet to be approved as a standard by SAE International. Upon the news on Tuesday afternoon, Tesla shares rose 3%. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a federally funded research center, reported that the U.S will be installing 1.2 million public EV chargers by the end of the decade, without providing a breakdown of NACs and CCSs. The White House has confirmed that EV charging stations that use Tesla-standard plugs will be eligible for federal subsidies that translate to a financial support worth billions of dollars.
The Charging Wars Win Also Comes With Risks For Tesla
By opening its charging network, Tesla became eligible for federal subsidies. But, this decision also brought in a portion of risk as the exclusive access to its fast supercharging network helped the EV king sells its cars to customers who did not want to wait behind Ford and GM vehicles. Musk has promised that GM, Ford, Rivian and Volvo customers will be treated like a Tesla customer and Tesla customers might not like that. Moreover, the reason why Tesla did so well is because it designed the whole system including the EV, the software that runs it and the charging hardware that powers it. Therefore, once other automakers like GM and Ford join its network, Tesla will no longer have absolute control. According to the Energy Department, Tesla has 19,700 charging ports across the United States located at about 1,800 stations but only 12,000 Tesla chargers will be open to Ford, GM, Rivian and now Volvo vehicles. Meanwhile, there are 10,500 CCS ports located at 5,300 stations so cars designed to use these plugs will be condemned with less reliable and slower charging.
An Acknowledgment Of Tesla’s Know-how
These agreements are a recognition of Tesla’s know-how in terms of the charging infrastructure. The charging infrastructure chapter in the EV book, which is an essential milestone towards an all-electric future, will undoubtedly be written by the EV king himself.

Black Fortune 500 CEOs reach another record high—just ...,26-Jun-23,Bozeman joins from Ford Motor where he served as vice president of its ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-fortune-500-ceos-reach-221756422.html,"Nine Black CEOs now lead Fortune 500 companies, setting a new record just weeks after Fortune marked eight earlier this month.
On Monday, Dave Bozeman became CEO of transportation and logistics company C.H. Robinson. Bozeman joins from Ford Motor, where he served as vice president of its customer services division and Ford Blue’s enthusiast vehicles unit for less than a year. Before that, he served as vice president of Amazon’s transportation services for over five years, leading supply chain optimization for customer delivery across the e-commerce giant’s global operations. There, he was instrumental in building its middle-mile global transportation network.
“I couldn’t be more excited about working with the incredible Robinson team as we embark on this next chapter of growth and success together. We will be building on a strong existing foundation, and the sky is the limit,” Bozeman wrote on LinkedIn following the announcement of his CEO appointment in early June.
Bozeman’s addition to the exclusive cohort of Black Fortune 500 chief executives is an optimistic sign that companies appear committed to increasing diversity in their highest ranks. Still, Black professionals only make up 1.8% of Fortune 500 CEOs—a far cry from the 56 additional corner office spots needed to reach parity with Black America’s 13% labor force participation rate.
“There are a plethora of talented, qualified, extraordinary leaders who happen to be Black. It’s never a surprise when they advance to the C-suite, or even to the CEO position,” Laura Morgan Roberts, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told Fortune earlier this month. “It says more about the company’s and the board of directors’ ability to recognize, develop, and advance talent from all backgrounds than it says about the representation of leaders themselves.”
Bozeman joins C.H. Robinson during a tumultuous period. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company has faced declining revenue amid waning demand for transportation services, resulting in two rounds of layoffs since November 2022. It’s also in an ongoing fight with activist investor Ancora Holdings Group, which has pressured the company to sell off its international freight forwarding unit. The company ousted former CEO Bob Biesterfeld in early January, while board chairman Scott Anderson stepped in to serve as interim CEO.
C.H. Robinson ranked at No. 160 on this year's Fortune 500 list, dropping from No. 154 in 2022. It brought in $24.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.
Reactions to Bozeman’s appointment have been mixed. Shares fell 5.3% after his appointment was first reported in early June, but some industry experts have suggested his experience at Amazon and industry-outsider status may help the company out of its slump. For his part, Bozeman told the Wall Street Journal that shareholders and activists would “say it’s the right company, with the right leader, at the right time” once they better understand his experience in “driving scale and building teams” and start seeing results.

Electric Vehicle Market to grow at a CAGR of 37.45% from ...,29-Jun-23,Ltd. Canoo Inc. Ford Motor Co. General Motors Co Hero Ecotech Ltd ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electric-vehicle-market-grow-cagr-004500353.html," NEW YORK, June 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The electric vehicle market size is estimated to grow by 25,927.15 thousand units during 2022-2027. The growth momentum will progress at a CAGR of 37.45% during the forecast period. The market is segmented by type (BEV and PHEV), charging (normal charging and supercharging), and geography (APAC, Europe, North America, South America, and Middle East and Africa). The market share growth by the BEV segment will be significant during the forecast period. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) is an EV powered by a battery and unlike the PHEV model, the only source of propulsion is the battery, which generates the power required by the vehicle. Rather than a fuel tank, a large battery is used to store the required energy to function the electric motor. As of 2019, some of the most popular models of BEV available in the market are Tesla Model 3, Nissan LEAF, and Renault ZOE. Some of the advantages of using BEVs are from the vendor point of view, due to its ease of manufacturing, BEV is one of the most manufactured vehicle types, When compared with PHEV, it requires considerably less expertise and capital; as BEV contains only one motor and a battery, there are fewer components in this model which makes the maintenance simple when compared with the counterparts; and most notably BEVs do not produce emissions, and therefore, they are called zero-emission vehicles. Such advantages are expected to drive the demand for BEVs during the forecast period. Download a Sample Report Now!

Electric Vehicle Market – Market Dynamics
Major Trends - 
Charging stations powered by renewable energy is an emerging trend shaping the electric vehicle market growth. Globally, there is a shift toward sustainable and energy-efficient modes of transport, and EVs are slowly becoming popular. The demand for electricity will significantly rise with more fleet operators opting for the electrification of vehicles and more consumers owning EVs. Thus, with the rising demand for electricity, utility companies are anticipated to shift to an alternative source of electricity. To address the growing electricity demands is to use renewable energy as an alternative and it's a cost-efficient and practical solution. Also, the steady reduction in the cost of renewable power generation will make electricity an attractive low-cost source to drive the transport sector. The rising adoption of renewable energy will further drive the global EV market as the burden on the power grid will be lesser. Therefore, the use of renewable energy to power the EV charging stations is expected to decrease the burden of electricity generation from the power grid and make the electrification technology more environmentally friendly. Hence, such factors will drive the market growth during the forecast period.
KEY challenges - 
The high manufacturing cost of EVs is a major challenge hindering the electric vehicle market growth. The cost of manufacturing EVs is higher than gas-powered vehicles, which is considered a significant barrier to the growth of the global market and the high cost of production limits the automakers from manufacturing more units of EVs. Similarly, for many consumers, the high price of EVs makes them less affordable, particularly in countries with low economic growth. Also, the lack of awareness among consumers about different incentives provided by the government adds up to the anxiety in consumers about buying EVs. However, the cost factor remains a major concern and a significant factor for consumers while buying vehicles. Therefore, the high cost of EVs is potentially a challenge to the growth of the global market during the forecast period.

Tesla (TSLA) Poses Investment Dilemma: Cash Out or Hold ...,26-Jun-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-poses-investment-dilemma-132700761.html,"We’re all highly familiar with Tesla TSLA, the undisputed EV leader and an investor favorite over the last decade. Following a tumultuous 2022, which marked a 65% decline in the stock price due to COVID-related lockdowns in China and Elon Musk's controversial acquisition of Twitter, Tesla has rebounded in a big way in 2023 so far. Year to date, shares of TSLA have rocketed around 108%, crushing the S&P 500’s growth of 14.4%.
So, what has been driving this surge? And considering the impressive rally, is it time to book profits finally?
Well, the shares are indeed pricey, currently trading at a 7.28X forward price-to-sales ratio, compared with the industry’s 1.81X. Still, investors have never really had much issue paying the premium, given the company’s strong growth trajectory and belief in Musk’s vision. So, should you hold onto Tesla based on its market leadership, progressively broadening global operations and new product developments? Or is this the right time to liquidate your holdings in anticipation of a potential correction?

Behind TSLA’s Remarkable Rebound in 2023
While the overall stock market rebound and the recovering economy have certainly played a role in Tesla’s stellar run on the bourses, the most significant gains have indeed materialized in the past few weeks, following a series of groundbreaking announcements.
Confirmation of eligibility for a $7,500 tax credit for all its Model 3/Y variants has provided the stock a major boost. What has further drawn investors’ attention is the widespread adoption of Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) port. Major automakers like General Motors GM, Rivian Automotive RIVN and Ford F announced their decision to embrace Tesla's NACS connector, which is steadily progressing toward becoming the prevailing industry standard across the continent.
It was Ford that got the ball rolling. Last month, Ford initiated this new trend by announcing that it would make its charging cords compatible with Tesla's NACS cables, granting Ford EV owners access to Tesla's vast Supercharger network. General Motors followed suit. On Jun 8, General Motors announced a collaboration with Tesla to integrate NACS plugs into its EVs starting in 2025. The collaboration will also provide GM EV drivers access to 12,000 Tesla Superchargers for charging their vehicles. They will get access to the Tesla Supercharger Network starting in 2024 and will initially require an adaptor.
Last week, Rivian announced plans to utilize the Supercharger network for charging its highly acclaimed R1T and R1S models, beginning in spring 2024.Additionally, beginning in 2025, Rivian intends to include NACS ports as a standard feature in their future R1 vehicles, as well as in the forthcoming R2 platform.
In response to the industry-wide evolution, leading charging equipment manufacturers Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EVgo and Wallbox announced plans to offer chargers featuring Tesla's connector, marking a significant turn away from the standard Combined Charging System (CCS) connector.With Tesla revolutionizing the charging landscape, the stock notched its longest winning streak on Jun 13. The EV behemoth ended its streak of 13 straight days of gains on Jun 14. Still, the stock is up around 33% in the past month.
Musk’s Autonomy Quest & Analysts’ Cautionary Words
Tesla’s market cap currently sits at more than $800 billion. During the VivaTech innovation conference in Paris, Musk emphasized that the company’s market cap hinges on its ability to achieve a breakthrough in autonomous driving. And Tesla is not at the forefront of that arena.
Despite the marketing claims of Tesla's driver assistance programs as being safe and fully functional, the reality is marred by a string of crashes resulting in injuries and loss of lives. This has cast doubt on the actual effectiveness of the technology. Between July 2021 and June 2022, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported 392 crashes involving driver-assistance programs, with Tesla accounting for nearly 70% of those incidents. In response to safety concerns raised by the NHTSA, Tesla issued a recall on February 16, 2023, affecting over 360,000 vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta, an experimental driver-assistance software.
Despite Elon Musk's optimism about Tesla's FSD platform and the company's plans to mass-produce a robotaxi by 2024, it is crucial to acknowledge that the technology is yet to be perfected. Despite Musk's repeated claims that Tesla is nearing a breakthrough in autonomous driving, the reality is that the company's cars still offer advanced driver assistance features rather than full autonomy. The timeline for achieving fully autonomous capabilities has faced delays, and while Tesla continues to work toward this goal, the technology has not yet been fully realized in their vehicles.
Last Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded its rating on Tesla from Overweight to Equal Weight, citing the anticipation of a potential cooling-off period for the company's shares after their impressive surge in 2023. Levy believes AI is a “long-dated” potential for Tesla and not a near-term prospect, so it’s better to “move to the sidelines.” The next day, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas – one of the Tesla bulls – also downgraded Tesla on reservations about the excessively optimistic AI-driven aspirations of the company.
What to Do With Tesla Shares?
According to Musk, the true value of Tesla lies in the potential of achieving full autonomy. However, the potential of AI for the company will take a significant amount of time to fully realize. As it is, Tesla's track record with driver-assistance programs has been marred by reported crashes and safety concerns. The stock will likely be volatile in the near term due to its valuation and is not suited for the fainted-hearted. We believe this is a suitable time for investors to consider capitalizing on their gains.
While risk-tolerant investors who believe Tesla’s autonomy breakthrough and Musk’s vision could still consider holding on to their investments, those speculative of its robotic narrative should consider offloading TSLA shares at the current levels.
TSLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has a VGM Score of C. The Zacks Consensus Estimate 2023 EPS suggests a year-over-year decline of 12.5%. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 EPS has been revised downward by 2 cents each over the past 30 days.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Ford Motor's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
The top 25 shareholders own 43% of the company
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
Every investor in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 59% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Ford Motor.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Ford Motor. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ford Motor's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Ford Motor. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in Ford Motor Company. Insiders own US$792m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Ford Motor. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
Next Steps:
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Ford Motor better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 is a bit unpleasant) that you should be aware of.
But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Ford auto sales rise on robust demand improved supply,06-Jul-23,(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co on Thursday followed rivals in reporting a rise in  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-auto-sales-rise-robust-131728457.html,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co on Thursday followed rivals in reporting a rise in second-quarter U.S. auto sales, driven by easing supply chain snags and pent-up demand for personal transportation.
The U.S. automaker's quarterly sales rose about 10% to 531,662 vehicles, the company said.
Automakers are rushing to make up for the lost production during the pandemic, as a strong jobs market props up demand for new vehicles despite inflation hurting consumers' pockets elsewhere.
Industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales in June were 1.37 million units, with an annual sales rate of about 15.7 million, according to data released by Wards Intelligence on Wednesday.
Ford's quarter was powered by a 26% jump in truck sales, one of the company's main profit drivers. Sales of the electric version of the company's popular F-150 truck more than doubled to 4,466 vehicles from last year.
However, Ford's overall EV sales fell 2.8% to 14,843 vehicles amid lingering supply snags.
In May, Ford temporarily halted its factory work at three plants where it makes both gasoline and electric versions of the F-150 pickup truck, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
The upbeat sales figures come amid a drive by the automaker to cut costs. The company last month said it would begin layoffs impacting mostly engineering jobs in the United States and Canada.
On Wednesday, Japan-based Toyota's North America unit reported a 7.13% rise in U.S. sales to 568,962 units, compared with Detroit's GM's 19% jump to 691,978 units for the quarter-ended June.

4 Strong Buy Stocks with Attractive Long-Term Prospects
Ahead of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report today, it still looks like a difficult year for stocks. Although there are a few bright spots, it's becoming somewhat harder to find them.
The first half of the year has been great, but that's just more reason for a slide in the second. Particularly because most of the rally was carried by tech stocks, that too, a few large ones. For other sectors, it hasn't been as great, as increased caution about an impending recession weighed on corporate spending patterns and increased investor concerns.
The Fed is determined to get to the 2% inflation rate on the basket of goods and services minus the highly volatile food and energy segments, and many of the officials have said that the effects of past actions may already have played out. If they have not – and that is a distinct possibility – there's a good chance that they will be raising rates anyway. Because the effect of past actions is a little tough to measure. The Fed's ""hawkish pause"" in June has fed sentiment on the street that a couple more hikes are on their way, in which case a recession may be unavoidable.
The JOLTS report could be positive, but the Fed is really putting the brakes on this market rally.
Therefore, this is no time to be beating around the bush. We need solid investments, stocks that will outperform others in the long run. Even better if they offer some income while we patiently hang onto them. So let's get down to it:
Ford Motor Company
Based in Dearborn, MI, Ford is a global automotive company that develops, manufactures and sells a range of vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands. It operates through various segments, including Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro; Ford Next; and Ford Credit. The company sells vehicles and service parts through dealerships, commercial fleet customers, rental car companies and governments. Ford also provides vehicle financing and leasing options to retail and commercial customers, as well as wholesale loans to dealers.
Ford's earnings are currently expected to decline. However, the company is seeing significant estimate revisions, so there could be a change in this situation. The 2023 estimate for example has increased 12 cents in the last 60 days (up 7.4%). Similarly, the 2024 estimate is up 8 cents (4.9%).
The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has grown its earnings over 10% in the last 5 years and is expected to grow at least 6% in the next five.
Its dividend yields 3.94%.
Despite the above positives, it trades at a reasonable valuation of 8.92X earnings. While at its highest level over the past year, it's a solid 79.4% discount to the industry. Since the industry's valuation is currently rich, we may also compare with a broader index such as the S&P 500. In this comparison too, it's a substantial discount of 54.4%.
Nexstar Media Group, Inc.
Irving, TX-based Nexstar is a television broadcasting and digital media company operating in the U.S. It acquires, develops and operates television stations, broadcast television networks, as well as interactive community websites. The company offers free programming to television viewers, employing both video and display advertising platforms across various digital media channels. It also manages real estate assets.
The Zacks Rank #1 company's earnings are expected to decline this year followed by a strong comeback in the next. In the last 60 days, its estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased $1.98 (17.7%) and $3.87 (14.8%), respectively.
The company has grown its earnings 41.8% in the last five years and analysts expect it to grow 10% in the long term.
Nexstar also pays a dividend that yields 3.23%.
The company trades at a significant discount to both the industry (75.3%) and the S&P 500 (60.8%), based on P/E.
Patterson Companies, Inc.
Headquartered in Saint Paul, MN, Patterson Companies is a distributor of dental and animal health products in the U.S., the UK and Canada. The company operates through three segments: Dental, Animal Health and Corporate.
The Dental segment offers a wide range of consumable products, dental equipment and practice optimization solutions. The Animal Health segment distributes various animal health products, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines and diagnostics. The Corporate segment provides customer financing services and sells miscellaneous products. Patterson serves healthcare professionals, veterinarians, animal health professionals and retailers.
Unlike the others, Patterson is expected to grow in both 2024 and 2025 (ending April), albeit at a low single-digit rate. Although not by a significant amount, analysts have also raised their estimates on this stock. For the fiscal year 2024, estimates increased 14 cents (6.0%) in the last 60 days while for the following year, they increased 16 cents (6.5%).
The company has grown its earnings 13.7% in the last five years and analysts expect this #1 ranked stock to grow its earnings 9.2% in the long run.
Patterson Companies' dividend yields 3.2%.
It is also trading at an attractive valuation, i.e. a 32.1% discount to its industry and a 34.9% discount to the S&P 500
Suzano S.A.
Based in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano specializes in the production and sale of eucalyptus pulp and paper products. It operates in two segments: Pulp and Paper. The company offers a wide range of paper products including printing and writing paper, paperboards, tissue paper and pulps. It is also involved in biofuel production, power generation, port terminals operation and wood-based textile fibers.
While current estimates reflect double-digit earnings declines in 2023 and 2024, it's worth noting that these estimates are increasing rapidly. The 2023 estimate for example is up 55 cents (34.8%) while the 2024 estimate is up 38 cents (29.2%).
It has grown a whopping 107.3% in the last five years, which explains the expected declines in the next two. However, analysts are projecting 6.9% growth in the next five years. Therefore, growth should return before long.
Suzano's dividend currently yields 3.43%.
The shares are trading at 4.8X P/E, a discount of 36.9% to the industry and 75.3% to the S&P 500.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-makes-history-first-3-085543690.html,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc became the first company in the world to reach a market value of $3 trillion, buoyed by hopes over its expansion in new markets coupled with expectations of a more moderate approach to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The iPhone maker's advance was among the most eye catching in a month marked by investor interest in the potential of artificial intelligence, with share buyers also particularly favouring companies with strong balance sheets and cash flows.
Apple's most recent quarterly report in May showing its revenue and profits beat analysts' expectations, and its track record of stock buybacks, reinforced its reputation as a safe investment during global economic uncertainty.
In a similar vein, electric car maker Tesla Inc witnessed a 28% jump in its market capitalization in June.
Tesla's surge was fuelled by deals struck by rivals Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co to gain access to Tesla's charging network, which could potentially establish Tesla's chargers as the industry standard.
Elsewhere Nvidia Corp joined the $1 trillion valuation club last month, as its market cap climbed 11.8%, with investors betting on its potential to become a major beneficiary of a boom in artificial intelligence.
The company's shares have soared following a revenue forecast that was more than 50% above the Wall Street estimate in May.
Apple and Microsoft Corp led the list of top 20 global companies by market capitalization at the end of June.
By contrast, Alphabet Inc's market cap dropped 2.3% last month to $1.53 trillion, on rising competitive pressures from Microsoft's Bing which has grown in prominence after the integration of the artificial intelligence behind ChatGPT.

This particular vehicle has even caused a headache to the EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) whose Cybertruck is expected to arrive later this year after several delays since it was unveiled back in 2019. Because of their size and capability, these electrified workhorses have emerged as a symbol of progress and efficiency that the EV revolution is promising to the transport industry. But, with Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) being among the rare ones who brought this vehicle to life on the road, many have started wondering the electric pickup promise is just a dream.
While even Tesla is on a long learning curve when it comes to the electric pickup-know, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) whose solar-powered tonneau cover will be empowering Hyundai’s Santa Cruz pickup, just revealed it will be opening its cutting-edge automotive product R&D Center in the heart of the U.S. which is known for its truck culture.
Worksport’s U.S. R&D Center A Diverse Group Of Cutting-edge Nasdaq-100 Companies
Worksport has chosen Springfield, MO for its research facility that will be hosting an impressive arsenal of over 70 patents across the automotive, consumer products, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors. Know-how that has been documented throughout Worksport’s intellectual property is one of the company’s key competitive advantages that will now be nurtured and further strengthened while Worksport’s 220,000 square feet manufacturing facility in West Seneca, N.Y. prepares to launch production. The reason why Worksport chose to place its R&D efforts at a separate location is to prevent its focus on innovation to get diluted by daily manufacturing operations. This way, Worksport will be able to refine its operations along the way while incubating new ground-breaking ideas in line with the company’s ambitious expansion plans, led by the development of its SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover and COR remote power and storage system. The R&D team will be able to follow up with new truck models so the company is able to craft its offerings and refine its existing ones by responding to crucial feedback data.
Through its intellectual creations, Worksport is clearly showing the world how will electric pickups change the world: from empowering us to thrive in what used to be inaccessible locations to conquering landscapes in a greener manner that gives hope of a more sustainable future, these trucks are more than vehicles, they are a fusion of cutting-edge technology and responsible innovation that aims to make the world a better place. This segment is also notoriously hard to break into with many brand partnerships that could also give Tesla a headache as it aims to keep everything in-house.
Tesla Pulled The Indexes Along For A Great June Ride
The S&P 500 had its best monthly performance since October as it gained 6.5% while the Nasdaq rose 6.6%, both pulling out a fourth consecutive positive month. As for the second quarter, the S&P 500 rose 8.3% for a third straight quarter of gains which is its biggest quarterly advance since 2021’s Q4, while the Nasdaq jumped 12.8%. During the first half of 2023, the S&P 500 popped 15.9%, marking its best first half since 2019 while the Nasdaq surged 31.7% which is its best first half since 1983.
Tesla, that makes 4.24% (according to data from June 29th, 2023) of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE: QQQ) that includes diverse group of cutting-edge Nasdaq 100 companies that are at the forefront of transformative long-term themes, enjoyed its shares going up 109% year-to-date due to the EV and AI hype combined. Tesla has been on an impressive run since General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor and Rivian announced they will be adopting its charging standard. During the relentless rise of the tech-focused Nasdaq, Tesla has also propped up the the S&P 500 index. With a market cap of approximately $830 billion, Tesla is also part of the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY).
Electric Pickups Could Easily Shake Things Up In The EV Revolution
Even Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY) is reportedly thinking of an electric pickup it unveiled it is planning to launch as many as 19 EVs by the end of the decade, while announcing it will be committing $500 million to convert its Canton Assembly plant to EV production and this is where it used to make its Frontier and Titan pickups. Also one of the reasons why pickups are such a lucrative market is their aftermarket filled with purchasable addons. Pickup drivers like to personalize their vehicles which will be an opportunity for Worksport and it will be interesting to see if Tesla will be willing to play along for a change.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us · Terms...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-green-energy-penny-170029347.html,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best green energy penny stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Best Green Energy Penny Stocks to Buy Now.
Renewable sources are on the fast track to making their mark in the energy industry and taking over the fossil fuel industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy sector investments are expected to be around $2.8 trillion. Renewable energy is expected to take up $1.7 trillion out of these investments. Between 2021 and 2023, green energy investments were expected to rise by 24% compared to 15% for fossil fuels.
For  Europe, The Russia-Ukraine war and the energy crisis in the continent have pushed it toward a faster adoption of renewable energy. The European Union reached a provisional deal with plans to increase the percentage of renewable energy in its total energy mix. By 2030, clean energy is expected to account for 42.5% of Europe's total energy mix, up from the current 32%.
The IEA predicts a 2400 GW growth in renewables between 2022 and 2027, marking an 85% acceleration compared to the previous five years. Green energy is expected to produce over 90% of global electricity capacity by 2027. Most of the growth will be accounted for by China. In the last three years, the number of energy storage companies in the country has more than doubled to 109,000. In the renewable energy mix, solar takes the lead and will likely grow by almost 1500 gigawatts (GW) between 2022 and 2027 to become the biggest source of energy by the end of the forecasted period.
Green Energy Industry in the US
The US renewable energy industry has picked up a significant pace in the last few years. In the last three years, renewable energy stocks such as Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) have grown by nearly 250% and over 280%, respectively. In 2023, the country’s new energy generation installations are expected to be 80% renewables. Solar energy accounts for 40% of the all-new generating capacity in the US and is expected to be 54% in 2023.
The Inflation Reduction Act was signed on August 16, 2022, by the Biden Administration. The act directs $400 billion to renewable energy in the form of funding and tax credits. The act benefits several clean energy stocks including NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP). The United States government has also provided subsidies on electric vehicles which benefit companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Electric vehicles are expected to account for 40% of the new car sales by 2030.
Renewable energy is still a growing business and is a long way from maturity. This leaves ample space for small companies to capture a portion of the clean energy industry. For investors, clean energy penny stocks hold the potential to become significant long-term investments. Some of the best renewable energy penny stocks include Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO), and ESS Tech, Inc. (NYSE:GWH).

Plug Into Tesla With These ETFs,03-Jul-23,Shares of Tesla TSLA have gained remarkably pushing the market value of  the electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer into the trillion-dollar range.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-tesla-etfs-163700216.html,"Shares of Tesla TSLA have gained remarkably, pushing the market value of the electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer into the trillion-dollar range. Due to this notable rally, several analysts have begun to question the stock's valuation, which has resulted in downgrades.
According to an article on Reuters, Goldman Sachs recently downgraded Tesla to a ""hold"" rating, aligning with Morgan Stanley and Barclays. Despite the downgrade, the brokerages adjusted their price targets to reflect the remarkable surge in Tesla shares, which have risen 71% since late April and more than doubled this year. While acknowledging the exceptional momentum, they remain optimistic about Tesla's prospects, anticipating robust growth in the coming period.
For investors looking to capitalize on Tesla's performance while mitigating risk, we present a selection of ETFs that offer significant exposure to the EV giant. These ETFs provide an opportunity to bet on Tesla’s success with reduced risk levels. Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR.
Investigating the Downgrade
As per Yahoo Finance, analysts question Tesla's ability to maintain its outstanding performance as the company's stock price soars further. Although it is acknowledged that the EV manufacturer has succeeded in building an ""EV castle"" with revenue sources like the supercharger network and collaborations with rivals like Ford F, General Motors GM and Rivian RIVN, questions continue to arise about the reliability of some growth drivers.
Particularly, analysts suggest that autonomous driving and generative AI are separate technological fields, raising doubts about the AI-related stock increase. Margin issues and price reductions are two pre-existing factors influencing the stock, according to Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.
Powering Past the Negatives
The appointment of a new CEO at Twitter, clever supercharging licensing arrangements, and an unusual spike in artificial intelligence-related equities combined to produce a perfect environment, causing share prices to skyrocket by more than 100% within a year.
Tesla's upward trend can be linked to a series of favorable developments during the last two months. Rival manufacturers Ford and General Motors have entered into agreements to acquire access to Tesla's charging network, which may cement it as the industry standard.
Furthermore, China's recent announcement of a significant $72.3 billion (520 billion yuan) tax cut package for EVs and other environmentally friendly vehicles boosted Tesla's stock even further.
The combination of these elements has catapulted Tesla to new heights, strengthening its status as a disruptive force in the automotive industry and making it the most significant global car firm in terms of market value.
Volvo Joins Ford and General Motors in a Significant Move
As mentioned in an article in Reuters, Volvo Cars VLVLY collaborated with Tesla to allow its EVs access to the latter’s renowned Supercharger network encompassing the United States, Canada and Mexico. Volvo becomes the first European automaker to adopt Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS), joining a growing list of EV manufacturers and charging equipment providers that have adopted this cutting-edge technology. Volvo vehicles in the three countries will be equipped with the NACS port beginning in 2025, allowing access to Tesla's Supercharger network.
Tesla’s EV Charging Superiority
As mentioned in a Reuters’ article, Tesla EV charging technology is quickly gaining popularity as a potential North American standard, offering a big boost to the company's attempts to broaden access to its formerly private charging infrastructure.
Multiple automakers have recently embraced Tesla's charging design, rejecting previous attempts by the Biden administration to establish the Combined Charging System (CCS) as the dominant standard in the United States. Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) is more readily accessible and reliable than the competing CCS charging network (Read: Top EV ETFs for Electrifying Gains as Charging Network Expands).
Revving Up Revenue
According to Investor’s business daily, Wall Street experts forecast Tesla's delivery to grow 74% to 445,000 units in Q2. This considerable year-over-year rise can be attributed to favorable comparisons to Q2 2022 when Tesla's Shanghai plant was temporarily closed due to COVID-19 lockdowns. Analysts predict that Tesla will supply around 1.82 million vehicles in 2023, exceeding the 1.313 million shipped in 2022.
Per Reuters, Tesla is on track to have another record-breaking quarter in China, thanks to robust sales. However, the business is facing increased rivalry from domestic rivals such as BYD, resulting in a modest loss in Tesla's market share in China's battery electric car segment. Analysts predict that Tesla will sell around 155,000 vehicles in China between April and June, a 13% rise over the previous record-breaking quarter.

The projected fair value for Ford Motor is US$11.83 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Ford Motor's US$14.98 share price signals that it might be 27% overvalued
Our fair value estimate is 19% lower than Ford Motor's analyst price target of US$14.61
In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
View our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What's The Estimated Valuation?
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$63b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$63b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$17b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$47b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$15.0, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

The Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Ford Motor
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.
Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.
Looking Ahead:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Ford Motor, there are three pertinent elements you should consider:

Top Ford exec faces felony charges after domestic dispute ...,11-Jul-23,Franck Louis-Victor an executive who joined Ford Motor Co. in 2021 from  Renault was arrested on Saturday at his home in Oakland County after a  domestic...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-top-ford-exec-faces-140139759.html,"Franck Louis-Victor, an executive who joined Ford Motor Co. in 2021 from Renault, was arrested on Saturday at his home in Oakland County after a domestic dispute involving a weapon and expensive purses.
Louis-Victor, 50, CEO of Ford Next LLC and vice president of new business platforms at Ford Motor Co., is accused of trying to set fire to two purses during a domestic incident. WDIV-TV (Channel 4) reported the bags were valued at $10,000 each. He was arrested and charged with two felonies: assault with a dangerous weapon and arson, based on preparation to burn property worth between $1,000 and $20,000.
The arson charge stems from Louis-Victor allegedly trying to set fire to two Hermes handbags, according to court records obtained by the Detroit Free Press. The assault with a dangerous weapon charge relates to an incident with a woman (whose name matches the co-owner of the home, according to property records) involving ""a butane torch and/or a computer tablet, but without intending to commit the crime of murder,"" court records say.
A judge ordered Louis-Victor to surrender his passport to the Bloomfield Township Police Department and not return to his home on the quiet cul-de-sac in the 100 block of Vorn Lane in Bloomfield Hills. The Free Press in general does not use the names of alleged domestic violence victims without their permission.
Franck Louis-Victor joined Ford Motor Co. as vice president of new business, the company announced on Monday, June 21, 2021. He was charged with two felony offenses stemming from a domestic incident on July 8, 2023.
At his arraignment in 48th District Court in Bloomfield Hills, a plea of not guilty was entered by the court. A judge set bond at $25,000 cash
A probable cause conference is scheduled for July 18, and a preliminary examination is scheduled for July 25. The court order, reviewed by the Free Press, indicates Louis-Victor cannot leave Michigan and cannot possess firearms.
If convicted, Louis-Victor could face up to five years for the arson charge and/or $10,000 or three times the value of property intended to be burned, whichever is greater; and up to four years and/or $2,000 in fines on the assault charge.

Amy Mast, Ford Next spokeswoman, told the Free Press on Tuesday, “We are aware of what has been reported in the press, but it would be inappropriate to comment on personal matters.”
Neith Louis-Victor nor his attorney could be reached for comment.
The incident was first reported by WDIV-TV (Channel 4).
At Ford, Louis-Victor is responsible for creating and launching business projects that create value for Ford, especially ""new, technology-forward customer experiences in various domains such as energy, supply chain, iOT, and distribution,"" according to his business profile on the Ford website.

Rising Concerns Regarding Safety to Propel Market Growth
One of the main factors fueling the market growth is growing concern among people for safety. Active safety features such as ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance systems), traction control (ASR), anti-lock brakes (ABS), tire-pressure monitoring systems (TPMS), and torque vectoring are standard equipment on SUVs. These features' main purpose is to prevent accidents by providing the driver with the highest level of protection.
The global SUV market is predicted to be stimulated by increased consumer preference for vehicles with safety features as a result of an increase in traffic accidents. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 1.25 million vehicle accidents worldwide in 2013, with over 50 million injuries and 93% of road traffic fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
Concerns Related to High Costs of Vehicles to Restrain Market Growth
The market's growth is anticipated to be hindered by the vehicles' high cost, poor fuel efficiency, and consumers' fluctuating preference for electric vehicles. The sport utility vehicle (SUV) market is further expected to encounter challenges from high maintenance costs and growing insurance premiums in the upcoming years.

Accelerated Expenditure on R&D Activities in North America to Drive Market Growth
North America is anticipated to retain its dominance in the global sport utility vehicles (SUVs) market due to rising expenditure on R&D activities and the presence of key players such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Hyundai Motor Company.
For instance, in September 2021, General Motors (GM) made a purchase from Oculii. GM may use the latter's inexpensive software to increase radar resolution for autonomous and self-driving cars.
The regional market is likely to expand due to factors such as the growing adoption of electric and self-driving cars, the increasing utilization of driver-assist technologies such as voice command and ADAS systems, and a rise in consumer per capita income.

Hyzon (HYZN) Successfully Completes Testing 9 200kW FCS,11-Jul-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Oshkosh Corporation  (OSK) ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyzon-hyzn-successfully-completes-testing-143300987.html,"Hyzon Motors Inc. HYZN announces the successful completion and factory acceptance testing of the first nine single-stack 200kW Fuel Cell System (FCS) B-samples at its Bolingbrook, IL, facility. This milestone reflects Hyzon’s progress toward the Start of Production and commercialization of its innovative FCS in 2024.  

The successful completion of testing follows the commissioning of Hyzon’s proprietary, automated roll-to-roll Membrane Electrode Assembly production line, including in-line inspection and the installation of its single-cell and fully automated fuel cell stack manufacturing lines.

The advancement of the 200kW FCS B-samples validates the design, equipment and operating procedures. All these elements are crucial for the final tooling and production of C-samples and the commercialization of the FCS.

Moreover, the company believes that it represents progress in the company’s prototype assembly rate. The company produced and tested six of the B-samples in the second quarter of 2023, up from three in the first quarter of 2023.

Hyzon is planning to ramp up the production of FCS by installing additional full- and semi-automation equipment in the assembly and inspection processes. Per the company, the continuous standardization of design around the 200kW FCS powertrain components will expedite production. Hyzon expects to complete the remaining 16 B-samples and start the production of C-samples in the second half of 2023.

Parker Meeks, CEO of Hyzon, said that the company aims to accelerate the clean energy transition by providing hydrogen fuel cells to power zero-emission mobility.

Hyzon’s single-stack 200kW FCS has an edge over current industry standards. Compared with most FCEV suppliers who couple two 110kW FCSs to achieve 200kW output, Hyzon has devised a technology to achieve the same using a single stack. This distinction will likely lead to a 20% increase in miles per kilogram of hydrogen compared with the 120kW FCS, 30% lower volume and weight, 25% lower cost and less maintenance than two 100kW long-range fuel cell systems.

With the increased emissions of diesel-powered vehicles — nearly 11 billion tons of carbon per year globally — the demand for hydrogen fuel cell systems remains strong. Also, the U.S. government is making notable investments in the industry via the Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Hub Program and other programs covered in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Beyond Altruism: Uncovering Tesla's Motives For Opening ...,11-Jul-23,By allowing Ford Motor Co. and General Motors to use the chargers Tesla  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-altruism-uncovering-teslas-motives-192115903.html,"Tesla Inc., renowned for its groundbreaking electric vehicles (EVs), surprised the industry by opening its charging infrastructure to competitors at no cost.
The decision sparked curiosity about CEO Elon Musk's motivations and Tesla's longer-term goals for charging stations. The decision is perhaps not pure altruism but instead, a play for Tesla to pull valuable data from other manufacturers' cars.
Tesla's Supercharger network stands as a testament to the company's dedication to creating a comprehensive and reliable charging infrastructure for EVs. With more than 45,000 charging stations worldwide, Tesla owners can fuel their journeys with convenient and rapid charging capabilities. By extending access to this infrastructure to competitors, Tesla not only encourages the adoption of EVs but also strives to establish a standardized and cohesive charging ecosystem that should benefit all EV drivers who want to travel without range anxiety.

The Power Of Data: Driving Tesla's Advantage
Beyond providing charging services, Tesla's charging network acts as an invaluable source of data. Each time a vehicle charges at a Supercharger station, Tesla gathers critical information pertaining to charging patterns, user behavior and energy consumption. By offering competitors access to its infrastructure, Tesla effectively expands its pool of data, enhancing its ability to refine charging technology, optimize network efficiency and enhance the overall user experience.
The current Tesla charging cable features three larger holes to move electricity to the batteries and two smaller data port holes. Tesla uses cellular and Wi-Fi connections to ""talk"" to its cars and pull data, but the charging ports provide it with even more information. By allowing Ford Motor Co. and General Motors to use the chargers, Tesla will likely take valuable data from those companies' vehicles.

When someone puts gas into their 2007 Toyota Camry, the only information they share is with the credit card terminal. The gas pump does not relay usage data and other information. Electric charging is different, as the battery-management system in an EV needs to relay some information to the charging source. Tesla's latest charging infrastructure transmits a trove of information, including a mix of technical data about the needed amount of charging and demographic information from the owner's payment. If Tesla's system can access a competitor's battery management system it can learn about broader charging patterns and needs. It could then sell this data to utility companies and also use it to optimize charging station locations, which could provide more profit than selling cars.
Fostering Standardization: A Path To Progress
The electric vehicle market is still in its nascent stages, and a significant obstacle hindering its growth is the absence of standardized charging infrastructure. By establishing a shared platform, Tesla encourages other automakers to produce electric vehicles that are compatible with the Supercharger network. This cooperative approach promotes interoperability, simplifies the charging experience for consumers and showcases the importance of collaboration to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. The company also will likely benefit greatly from charging data, reflecting Tesla's status as more of a data company than a car company.

Latch (LTCH) Slashes Jobs to Cut Costs & Improve Efficiency,11-Jul-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Oshkosh Corporation  (OSK) ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/latch-ltch-slashes-jobs-cut-162600701.html,"After completing the acquisition of Honest Day's Work earlier this month, Latch, Inc. LTCH has announced its intention to significantly reduce its workforce in the United States and Taiwan, with a reduction of nearly 59%. This strategic move is part of Latch's ongoing efforts to enhance operational performance and effectiveness. The layoffs will be completed by Nov 1, 2023.

The buyout has enabled the company to speed up its cost-saving process. The lowered headcount allows Latch to take up additional cost-cutting measures to be implemented on SaaS software licenses and other systems. Through this strategic initiative, Latch aims to create a scalable foundation for growth.

Apart from trimming its workforce, the company has rejigged its management team. Jamie Siminoff is expected to serve as CEO later this year; Luciano Panaro will serve as Chief Technology Officer; David Lillis is expected to become Chief Financial Officer; Claire Duval will become VP of Operations; Eugenia Adjigogovic will become Head of People and Chris Peckham has recently joined as Head of Sales.

Latch has an efficient remote global workforce, which will become most efficient when co-located in St. Louis. Through this hybrid approach, the company will source global talent with a centralized office in St. Louis to support a sustainable business.

Siminoff backed the new measures by saying that they will set the stage for long-term business growth. By providing high-quality products and services at the lowest cost, the company will be able to improve sales and profits and create value for its stockholders.

The newly appointed team has ample knowledge and experience to meet the unique requirements of Latch. Lillis will join Latch as a CFO later this year and oversee financial planning, analysis, reporting and treasury management. He will work alongside the executive team to streamline processes, optimize costs and provide actionable insights to make informed decisions.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us · Terms...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-gears-report-q2-155600953.html,"Ford Motor Compay F is slated to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 48 cents a share. The bottom-line projection implies a year-over-year decline of 29.41%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s second-quarter earnings per share has moved north by 2 cents in the past 30 days.

The U.S. auto biggie beat earnings estimates in the last reported quarter. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford surpassed earnings estimates twice and missed on the other two occasions, the average surprise being 24.35%. This is depicted in the graph below:
Ford Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise
 Ford Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise
Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote
Q1 Highlights
Ford’s first-quarter adjusted earnings came in at 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. The bottom line rose 65.8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 38 cents. The company’s consolidated first-quarter revenues came in at $41,474 million, up 20.3% year over year.

Ford reported an adjusted free cash flow of $693 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $22,144 million as of Mar 31, 2023 compared with $25,134 million on Dec 31, 2022. The automotive long-term debt increased to $19.1 billion from $19.2 billion as of 2022-end.
Things to Note Ahead of Q2 Release
The U.S. legacy automaker has started reporting its automotive results under three business segments — Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro. While Ford Blue focuses on the firm’s legacy gas-powered business, Ford Model e focuses on EVs, advanced technologies and several related aspects to support electrification plans and Ford Pro deals with commercial vehicles and services.

Ford’s second-quarter revenues are likely to have been aided by a projected increase in Ford Blue wholesale units. For the quarter under review, our estimate for Ford Blue wholesale shipments is pegged at 720,000 units, indicating an increase from 670,000 units in the year-ago period. Our forecast for second-quarter Ford Blue sales is $24,061 million, implying an uptick from $23,834 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.

Ford recorded sales growth of 11.2% in the United States during the second quarter of 2023. Ford’s F-Series became America’s top-selling truck with a 34% rise in sales in the quarter under review. Ford truck sales gained momentum in the second quarter due to strong performance of new Super Duty and improved inventory flow.

For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBIT for Ford Pro to be around $1,480 million, up from $879 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022. Profit from the Ford Pro segment is likely to have boosted the second quarter results.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford for the to-be-reported quarter, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is the case here.

Earnings ESP: Ford has an Earnings ESP of +3.73%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 2 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

But  which of...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/f-vs-tsla-stock-better-154013619.html,"Investors interested in stocks from the Automotive - Domestic sector have probably already heard of Ford Motor Company (F) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Ford Motor Company has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that F's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.
F currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.41, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 79.57. We also note that F has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.23.
Another notable valuation metric for F is its P/B ratio of 1.42. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 18.26.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to F's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.
F has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSLA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that F is the superior option right now.

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos ·  Yahoo Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-supplier-magna-invest-790-120828547.html,"(Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc said on Thursday it will invest $790 million to build three new supplier facilities, two of which will be housed at Ford Motor Co's BlueOval City campus in Tennessee.
The development comes as suppliers race to meet requirements from automakers, who have been hustling to boost their electric vehicle output as demand for environmentally friendly vehicles surges.
Magna's facilities will support production of Ford's second-generation electric truck, the Canadian company said in a statement. One facility at Ford's campus will make battery enclosures for the truck and a second will make polyurethane foam and seats.
Ford in March said it plans to build up to 500,000 electric trucks a year at its BlueOval City complex under construction. The complex will assemble several versions of Ford's next-generation F-series electric pickup, which the company calls Project T3.
In May, the Detroit-based automaker also unveiled an ambitious strategy to profitably ramp up EV sales though it faces a challenging act of slashing $7 billion in costs.
A third Magna facility in Lawrenceburg will produce vehicle frames, the company said.
Production at all three plants is scheduled to begin in 2025. The investment is expected to create up to 1,300 jobs, Magna said.

Upon Ford’s news on Monday, Ford shares dropped 5.9%, GM followed with 3.1 % and Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) with a 3.3% drop, while Tesla shares rose 3.2% as its Cybertruck went into production.
Despite Challenges, GM Is Determined To Ramp Up Its EV Output
Despite battery supply chain disruptions, Rory Harvey, GM’s president of North America anticipated that the automaker will build a significantly higher number of EVs in the remaining half of the year, following a disappointing second quarter in EV sales. The sales slowdown came as GM focused on developing new EV models on its flexible Ultium platform that is designed to optimize production, once supply chain issues are resolved. The first EV that got off the platform, the GMC Hummer EV, experienced low sales in the first two quarters of the year with an 83% decline compared to 2022’s figures.
EV troubles are mounting up as on July 18th, GM’s CAMI Assembly electric vehicle plant in Ingersoll, Ontario has reportedly closed for the month unexpectedly due to a battery shortage, according to The London Free Press. Currently, GM only produces Ultium batteries at the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown, Ohio with plans to build a second plant in Tennessee in 2024 and a third in Michigan in 2025.
GM expects to leave behind these challenges soon as it plans to launch three new high-volume Ultium EVs from Chevrolet by the end of the year, namely the Silverado EV, Equinox EV, and Blazer EV. GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico stated that first Chevy Blazer EV is on its way to the US.
While GM executives are confident in increasing EV production this year, the automaker’s history of unfulfilled promises leaves plenty of space for concern. However, GM is actively expanding its battery capacity, which according to CEO Mary Barra is the main bottleneck, but it will take time to reach optimal production levels.
Ford Announces Significant Price Cuts
On Monday, Ford intensified the EV price war in the U.S. with price cuts for its flagship electric pickup, the electric version of America’s most beloved pickup, F-150.Ford announced that seven F-150 Lightning models will be discounted by 6 to 17%. Back when Tesla began the price war by slashing its vehicle prices by $13,000 at the beginning of the year, Ford responded by cutting prices for its electric SUV, the Mustang Mach-E, but then Tesla discounted its Model S and Model X vehicles in March.
Also on Monday, Ford cited that the discounted pricing is the result of its increased plant capacity at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan, a lower cost of raw materials and batteries with benefits of scaled production. The Rouge plant is currently closed for final plant upgrades as the Blue Oval plans to triple its annual F-150 Lightning production rate to 150,000 as of this autumn. Tesla’s price war which resulted in Ford’s and GM’s discounting of prices resulted in higher sales for all three carmakers. Tesla led with a 466,000 EVs in its April to June quarter, with Ford selling almost 15,000 EVs in the April to June quarter and GM doubling its EV sales that exceeded 15,000. Moreover, F-150 Lightning sales skyrocketed 119% compared to 2022’s comparable quarter and therefore, the latest move is likely to intended to keep up the strong momentum.
China Remains Way Ahead Of The U.S. When It Comes To EVs
Though local EV brands are dominating the world’s greatest EV market, General Motors and Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) are fighting for their piece of the pie in China with Tesla certainly making it even harder with its Shanghai factory. But even Tesla is not the EV king in China as the industry leader is BYD — a Shenzhen-based Warren Buffet-back company whose name stands for “Build Your Dreams,” is by all means the world’s biggest EV seller, including hybrids. On the back of an antitrust law, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a pledge made this month by Tesla and 15 other automakers to avoid abnormal pricing was retracted. So even Tesla does not have a clear path ahead in China. China is also a clear leader in EV batteries as Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley emphasized during the Morgan Stanley’s sustainable finance summit in May, with the automaker’s biggest rival not being GM or Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) but Chinese EV makers such as BYD, with the country itself being a threat with its dominance in raw materials supply such as lithium and the supply chain.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-discounts-set-power-quarterly-100508583.html,"(Reuters) — Tesla's (TSLA) strategy to boost sales through price cuts is likely to have powered its strongest revenue growth in five quarters while dragging down margins to a three-year low in the April-June period.
The Elon Musk-led electric-vehicle maker has since late last year launched a price war to stoke demand and quell competition from legacy automakers such as Ford Motor and Chinese rivals including BYD (BYDDY).
Tesla's earnings on Wednesday are expected to show its gross profit margin declined to 18.9% in the second quarter, according to 19 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. That is a drop from 20.2% in the previous quarter and 25.9% a year earlier.

The only reason Tesla delivered slightly more cars in the second quarter than the previous three months was because it discounted heavily at the cost of its margins, said Vitaly Golomb, an investment banker who focuses on mobility.
""It is clear they are very much a car company with the same supply chain and demand pressures as other manufacturers. They even have a growing inventory of their three- and six-year-old design Model 3s and Model Ys and really seem to have hit a certain saturation point on demand.""
The world's most valuable automaker produced 13,560 more vehicles in the quarter than it handed to customers. While that gap narrowed from first-quarter numbers, it's a concerning trend for the company that predicted in October it would sell every car it manufactured in the foreseeable future.
A lack of new models has also made it tougher for Tesla to take on rivals in China, where an uneven economic recovery and fresher, glitzier offerings from local players have weighed on demand.
Tesla booked record deliveries of its China-made cars in the quarter but its share of the country's pure electric and plug-in hybrid market fell to 8.8% from 10.5% in the first three months of 2023, according to a Reuters calculation based on numbers from a Chinese auto industry body.
""Tesla's market share for the EV segment is likely to decline over time,"" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said. ""However, I think the more appropriate metric to look at is Tesla's total auto market share, which continues to grow as they continue to grow deliveries.""
CHARGING AHEAD
As EV sales slow, Tesla has been moving aggressively to capture a larger share of the U.S charging market in a bid to diversify its revenue.
It has tied up with companies including Ford Motor and General Motors for use of its North American Charging Standard (NACS), a move that has helped its market value more than double this year to $880 billion.
Following these partnerships, several charging companies said they would adopt the Tesla standard.
While this will contribute little to second-quarter revenue, which is expected to rise 45.2% to $24.59 billion, according to Refinitiv, analysts predict it will boost the company's top line significantly in the future.
Piper Sandler estimates Tesla's revenue from its charging network to hit $9.65 billion in 2032, with more than half the sales coming from EVs made by other carmakers using its network.

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher to kick off the trading week on Monday, buoyed by gains in financial and technology shares as investors awaited the next round of quarterly results this week as earnings season gathers speed.
Companies scheduled to report earnings this week include Tesla and Netflix, while more big banks in the form of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are also on the docket to post results, following reports from peers such as JP Morgan and Citigroup last week.
Investors will be paying attention to company outlooks, with earnings for the quarter expected to decline 8.1%, according to Refinitiv data, a bigger decline than the 5.7% fall expected at the start of the month.
""Obviously, we are about to get all these (earnings) reports but it feels to me earnings are going to be good and at the end of the day, how do you value stocks – based on the earnings and dividends,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.
""By and large, the market in its totality continues to be reasonably priced if not kind of cheap. My bigger concern going forward is the Fed is going to start doing things it doesn’t need to do to win the inflation battle but will ultimately now really start to hurt the economy.""
Equities have rallied recently, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbing to 15-month highs as economic data has pointed to a resilient economy, with inflation cooling and a solid labor market.
Markets have largely priced in a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its policy meeting next week, with expectations at 97.3%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 76.32 points, or 0.22%, to 34,585.35, the S&P 500 gained 17.37 points, or 0.39%, to 4,522.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 131.25 points, or 0.93%, to 14,244.95.
The S&P and Nasdaq have advanced in five of the past six sessions.
Tesla gained 3.20% after the company said on Saturday it had built its first Cybertruck, after two years of delays.
In contrast, Ford Motor tumbled 5.94% after the automaker cut the price of its F-150 Lightning trucks, the latest salvo in a deepening price war among electric vehicle makers. Peer General Motors shed 3.13% and Rivian lost 3.34%.
Apple advanced 1.73% after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the iPhone maker to $220 from $190, citing a bullish outlook on India as an emerging growth driver for the company.
Bank shares recovered from Friday's losses, with the S&P 500 bank index up 1.76% and the KBW regional bank index advancing 1.99%.
Activision Blizzard rose 3.49% after Microsoft said it has signed an agreement to keep ""Call of Duty"" on PlayStation following its acquisition.
In addition, Microsoft was granted a two-month pause of its appeal over Britain's block against the deal to give the parties more time to reach an agreement.
AT&T slumped 6.69% to a 30-year low after Citi downgraded the telecom operator over risks tied to lead cables left buried in the United States. Verizon shares dropped 7.50%, hitting their lowest intraday level in nearly 13 years.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.75-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 150 new highs and 77 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.54 billion shares, compared with the 10.92 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Will Tesla's Cybertruck Push Up ETFs Heavy on the EV Maker?,18-Jul-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · General Motors  Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-cybertruck-push-etfs-heavy-230800078.html,"According to a tweet from Tesla TSLA on Jul 15, the company has finally completed the construction of its first Cybertruck at its manufacturing facility in Austin, TX. According to Reuters, this achievement comes after a two-year delay. Back in 2019, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, unveiled the pickup truck, during which the vehicle's designer accidentally broke the supposedly indestructible ""armor glass"" windows.
Since then, Tesla has faced multiple setbacks and had to postpone the production timeline. Last year, Musk attributed the delay to component shortages for the Cybertruck. However, during a shareholder meeting in May, Musk expressed the company's goal of manufacturing around 250,000 Cybertrucks annually, depending on market demand.
The launch of the Cybertruck will allow Tesla to enter one of the most lucrative sectors of the U.S. market, providing competition to electric pickups offered by Ford Motor F and Rivian Automotive RIVN. Although both Ford and Rivian have already introduced their respective models in limited quantities, Tesla's entry into this segment is highly anticipated.
Strong Quarterly Growth to Drive Profits?
Tesla's aggressive pricing cut strategy, aimed at boosting sales and fending off competition, likely fueled its most robust revenue growth in five quarters. However, per Reuters, Tesla's earnings on Jul 19, are expected to show to a decline in profit margins, reaching a three-year low for the April to June period. The electric vehicle manufacturer initiated a price war in late 2022 to stimulate demand and counter competition posed by traditional automakers like Ford Motor and Chinese counterparts like BYD.
Although only marginally higher than the prior three months, the second quarter's growth in Tesla vehicle deliveries can be linked to the company's significant discounts, which came at the expense of its profit margins.
In an effort to expand its revenue streams amid a slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) sales, Tesla has taken assertive steps to gain a larger market share in the U.S. charging industry. By collaborating with notable companies such as Ford Motor and General Motors GM, Tesla has facilitated the adoption of its North American Charging Standard, which has propelled Tesla's market value to $880 billion.
While the immediate impact on second-quarter revenue due to these partnerships is expected to be minimal, with Refinitiv projecting a 45.2% increase to $24.59 billion, analysts anticipate a significant boost to Tesla's top line in the future.
By diversifying into the charging market and establishing itself as a prominent standard, Tesla aims to mitigate the effects of sluggish EV sales and tap into new avenues for revenue generation.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 22 cents per share for the quarter, flat with the year-ago period’s reported bottom line.

The estimate for second-quarter 2023 loss per share has remained unchanged over the past 90 days. In the last reported quarter, this solid-state battery maker reported a net loss per share of 24 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents.

Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the bottom-line estimate once, missed twice and matched on the remaining occasion, the average negative surprise being 8.58%.

 Things to Note
As per its pre-established target, QuantumScape started shipping 24-layer A0 cells to customers at the end of 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, the company completed customer testing of 24-layer A0 prototype cells and zero externally applied pressure single-layer prototype cells.

The battery developer is trying to improve its cathode capacity loading to nearly 5 mAh/cm2, up from the current capacity of 3mAh/cm2, to optimize the battery's energy density. It is also trying to improve the efficiency of cell packaging and the quality and consistency of materials and processes. These developments bode well for its upcoming results.

On the other hand, escalating expenses remain a major challenge for QS and the trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported. In the last reported quarter, the company’s capital expenditure and cash operating expenses were $28 million and $62 million, respectively.

For full-year 2023, the company expects capex to range between $100 million and $150 million and cash operating expenses to range between $225 million and $275 million.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Ford Motor’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What's The Opportunity In Ford Motor?
The stock is currently trading at US$13.26 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 38% compared to my intrinsic value of $9.58. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ford Motor's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 71%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? F’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe F should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on F for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for F, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
If you want to dive deeper into Ford Motor, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. To help with this, we've discovered 4 warning signs (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Ford Motor.

Why Earnings Season Could Be Great for Ford (F),26-Jul-23,Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote. Why is  this ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-season-could-great-140300831.html,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ford F may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Ford is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for F in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 55 cents per share for F, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for F, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +8.07% heading into earnings season.

Why is this Important?
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that F has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ford, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Ford recalls 870K F-150 pickups in US because parking ...,28-Jul-23,Associated Press Finance ... 24 2021 file photo shows a Ford company logo  on a sign at a Ford dealership in southeast Denver. Ford Motor is reporting  earnings on...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-recalls-870k-f-150-115056155.html,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 870,000 newer F-150 pickup trucks in the U.S. because the electric parking brakes can turn on unexpectedly.
The recall covers certain pickups from the 2021 through 2023 model years with single exhaust systems. Ford's F-Series pickups are the top-selling vehicles in the U.S.
The company says in documents posted by government safety regulators Friday that a rear wiring bundle can come in contact with the rear axle housing. That can chafe the wiring and cause a short circuit, which can turn on the parking brake without action from the driver, increasing the risk of a crash.
Drivers may see a parking brake warning light and a warning message on the dashboard.
Ford says in documents that it has 918 warranty claims and three field reports of wire chafing in North America. Of these, 299 indicated unexpected parking brake activation, and 19 of these happened while the trucks were being driven.
The company says it doesn't know of any crashes or injuries caused by the problem.
Dealers will inspect the rear wiring harness. If protective tape is worn through, the harness will be replaced. If the tape isn't worn, dealers will install a protective tie strap and tape wrap.
Owners will be notified by letter starting Sept. 11.

Yahoo  Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us  · Terms and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-sector-q2-earnings-roster-121800816.html,"The second-quarter 2023 earnings for the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector kicked off last week. So far this earnings season, four S&P sector components — namely Tesla, Genuine Parts, PACCAR and General Motors — have come up with quarterly numbers. EV king Tesla, trucking giant PACCAR and U.S. legacy automaker General Motors managed to pull off a comprehensive beat and witnessed year-over-year growth in the top and bottom lines. Meanwhile, auto replacement parts provider Genuine Parts’ earnings topped estimates but sales missed the same. Revenues and profit, however, increased on a year-over-year basis.
Ford F, Harley-Davidson HOG, Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and LKQ Corp LEA are some of the auto stocks lined up to report tomorrow. Before checking the key projections for these stocks, let's take a look at the general factors that are likely to shape the companies’ upcoming results.
With supply chain issues easing this year, the U.S. auto market has regained momentum. Most automakers experienced year-over-year vehicle sales growth in the second quarter of 2023, thanks to improving inventory levels. Additionally, the demand for automobiles remained strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions.
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for June 2023 was 15.7-15.8 million vehicles, up from 15.1 million vehicles in May 2023 and 12.9 million units in June 2022. Per Cox Automotive, new vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively.
Per the latest Earnings Trend report dated Jul 19, the auto sector’s earnings for the second quarter of 2023 are expected to grow 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to rise 17.1% year over year.
Key Releases on Jul 27
Ford: This legacy automaker surpassed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected revenues. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford topped earnings estimates on two occasions for as many misses, with the average surprise being 24.35%. This is depicted in the graph below:

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford this time around. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +6.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 50 cents per share. F is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.
Ford recorded sales growth of 11.2% in the United States during the second quarter of 2023. Its F-Series became America’s top-selling truck, with a 34% rise in sales in the quarter. Ford’s second-quarter revenues are likely to have been aided by a projected increase in Ford Blue wholesale units. For the to-be-reported quarter, our estimate for Ford Blue wholesale shipments is pegged at 720,000 units, indicating an increase from 670,000 units in the year-ago period.
Our forecast for second-quarter Ford Blue sales is $24,061 million, implying an uptick from $23,834 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022. On the flip side, we expect a year-over-year decline in the adjusted EBIT from Ford Blue, Ford Credit and Ford Next. Our projection for operating loss from Model e unit is at $907.8 million, wider than $510 million recorded a year ago.
Harley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle manufacturer posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-anticipated revenues from the Motorcycles & Related Products and Financial Services segments.

Harley-Davidson is likely to have benefited from the Hardwire strategic plan, which aims at growth through refreshed product offerings. Our estimate for HOG’s revenues from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment — which constitutes the bulk of the firm’s overall revenues — is pegged at $1,325.5 million for the June-ended quarter, suggesting an increase of 4.7% year over year.
We project operating profit from the segment to grow around 23% from the year-ago period. On the flip side, our forecast for revenues from Financial Services is pegged at $200.9 million, suggesting a fall from $202.6 million generated in the year-ago period. Our model estimate for operating profit from the segment is $66.7 million, implying a decline from $85.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022.
LKQ: This automotive replacement parts provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter due to better-than-expected revenues from Wholesale North American, European and Self-Service segments. LKQ surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 2.54%. This is depicted in the graph below:

LKQ’s North America segment results are likely to get a boost from pricing initiatives. The company’s 1 LKQ Europe program is expected to aid the performance of the Europe segment. Moreover, the strength in LKQ’s Specialty unit on the back of solid demand for recreational vehicles bodes well.Our estimate for revenues from parts and services in Europe is pegged at $1,500 million, suggesting a rise from $1,470 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.
We expect revenues from parts and services in the North America unit at around $1,103.7 million, indicating a rise from $1,050 million recorded in the prior-year period. However, our projection for the Specialty segment stands at $447.5 million, implying a decline from $512 million reported in the prior-year quarter.
Allison: The transmission manufacturer posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-anticipated sales from North America On-Highway, North America Off-Highway and Service Parts, Support Equipment & Other end markets. ALSN surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 12.84%. This is depicted in the graph below:

For second-quarter 2023, we estimate North America On-Highway and Off-Highway market revenues to be around $358 million and $23.7 million, up from $340 million and $20 million, respectively, reported in the corresponding quarter of 2022. Our forecast for Outside North America On-Highway market revenues is $119 million, up from $105 million recorded in the year-ago period. Our projections for Outside North America Off-Highway market revenues suggest a year-over-year decline of 2.9%.
We expect revenues from the Defense and the Service Parts, Support Equipment/ Other segments at $35.5 million and $162 million, respectively, suggesting an uptick from $29 million and $138 million, respectively. While expected sales growth from most segments boost optimism, logistics challenges, including air and ocean freight and port delays, labor constraints and high engineering costs are likely to have played a spoiler in the to-be-reported quarter.

6 Cheap Solid State Battery Stocks to Buy,28-Jul-23,General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has set an ambitious target to manufacture  1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025. Similarly Ford Motor Company  (NYSE:F)...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-cheap-solid-state-battery-141435090.html,"In this article, we will look at 6 cheap solid-state battery stocks to buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the solid-state battery market and explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 3 Cheap Solid State Battery Stocks to Buy.
The lithium-ion batteries commonly utilized in smartphones and electric vehicles (EVs) currently available in the market are predominantly liquid-state batteries. These batteries employ a liquid electrolyte solution to facilitate the movement of ions between the cathode (positive) and anode (negative), resulting in the generation of electrical potential. In contrast, solid-state batteries, as implied by their name, eliminate the liquid electrolyte and substitute it with a solid material such as ceramics or glass. This shift to a solid substance enables the functioning of the battery. According to a research report by Allied Market Research, the global solid-state battery market size was valued at $0.5 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18% from 2021 to 2030.
The advantages of solid-state batteries are twofold. Firstly, they offer enhanced safety compared to liquid-state batteries, which are susceptible to hazardous failures when damaged. Secondly, and of significant importance to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, removing the liquid component from batteries allows for increased electrical generation capacity. The technology has achieved significant advancement in recent years.
This battery technology has also caught the eye of the U.S. government and the aviation industry. This past year, NASA's Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety (SABERS) team successfully developed a high-performing solid-state battery with the potential to store ample electricity and discharge it rapidly, making it a promising candidate for efficiently powering electric aircraft. Regarding this breakthrough, Rocco Viggiano, principal investigator for SABERS at NASA’s Glenn Research Center made the following remarks:
“We’re starting to approach this new frontier of battery research that could do so much more than lithium-ion batteries can. Not only does this design eliminate 30 to 40 percent of the battery’s weight, it also allows us to double or even triple the energy it can store, far exceeding the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries that are considered to be state of the art ”
Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), the automotive giant, has made significant strides in solid-state battery technology, proclaiming a ""technological breakthrough"" that could revolutionize the range capabilities of their electric vehicles (EVs). According to Toyota's assertions, advancements in aerodynamics, design, and battery technology will enable their EVs to travel over twice the distance of current models, covering a remarkable 1,200 kilometers on a single charge. Additionally, they anticipate a quick recharge time of 10 minutes or less. The company plans to introduce these advancements to the market between 2027 and 2028, aiming for a commercial rollout. They further express optimism that ongoing research could extend the cruising range even further, reaching an impressive 1,500 kilometers on a single charge. By comparison, the long-range version of the Tesla Model 3 currently offers a range of 602 kilometers.
While relatively new and emerging compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries are set to generate hefty profits if the aforementioned developments are anything to go by. This becomes more evident when we factor the various ambitious goals that certain EV makers have set for themselves. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has set an ambitious target to manufacture 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025. Similarly, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) aims to produce 2 million electric vehicles per year by 2026. Meanwhile, Volkswagen's vision is even bolder, aiming for 80% of EV sales in Europe and 55% in the U.S. by 2030.

How Smart Money Is Playing The $700 Billion EV Boom,30-Jul-23,... financial statements and other pertinent corporate information about  the company. ... Yahoo Finance. All 737-Max 9 jets to remain grounded until  Boeing sends new...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-money-playing-700-billion-000000699.html,"China is the “800-pound gorilla” of global EV supplies, and it dominates this market in every way, including sales. Last year, China’s exports of EVs increased 131.8% YoY to some 680,000 units, based on official data. In the first half of 2023, the Chinese sold 2,093,000 EVs.
Last year’s and this year’s global EV markets are breaking all kinds of records, but China is the clear frontrunner—by miles—accounting for around 60% of global electric car sales, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). More than half of the EVs on the roads today, are in China, and it’s already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy vehicles.
In Europe, the second largest market, EV sales rose by over 15% in 2022, while sales in the United States – the third largest market – increased 55% in 2022, reaching a global share of 8%.
Electric vehicle sales are set for a 35% year-on-year increase in 2023, with national policies and incentives providing further impetus for producers and consumers. So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors, especially considering that the top 14 EV stocks with only a fraction of the market capitalization of their traditional auto giant peers ended up outperforming them on the stock market.
And the next wave is in the water.
The recreational electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.
As the electric vehicle playing field shifts to the waterways, it’s not surprising to find celebrity figures such as NFL superstar Tom Brady joining in by buying an electric boat racing team for the inaugural UIM E1 World Championship, which will launch in early 2024.
But Vision Marine is already on the waterways with, with a first-of-its-kind proprietary outboard motor and powertrain powering the newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat, which made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries set to start this summer.
The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.
That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.
This is only the beginning.
VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system can turn any boat into an electric boat.
And its sales strategy removes any notion of the unwanted cash burn that EV manufacturers are burdening investors with right now. VMAR plans to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs in an incredibly savvy move in a market flooded with struggling, cash-negative EV makers. VMAR is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year.
VMAR is also developing an electric system for pontoons and a major second revenue chain that involves completely flipping the massive boat rental market from ICE to electric.
With the build-out well underway, VMAR now says it is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.
The World’s Most Powerful Electric Powertrain
Vision Marine has already made history once.
Last fall, the company broke the world electric boat speed record at 109 MPH in a 100% electric boat in the Lake of the Ozarks Shootout, the largest boating event of the year in North America.
Now, it’s about to do it again, on a journey that (in their own words) “will challenge the limits of what was thought possible”.
Armed with cutting-edge electric propulsion technology, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR), is equipping its Zenith pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America. This month, they will embark on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida.
 Vision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.
The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.
The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.
The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a pricing perspective, it beats everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.
For Vision Marine, this first-mover advantage is key, and it’s already received advance orders from OEMs.
Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received an initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024.

VMAR also plans to completely transform  the massive, global boat rental market already valued at well over $18 billion and on its way to topping $30 billion by 2031.
Here, too, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) is in a leadership position, with its flagship Newport business serving 300,000 clients in the first three years, and annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin. The plan for the rest of this year is to build this out with two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and the launch of a franchise model. After that, it’s smooth sailing and all about scaling, scaling, scaling.
By the end of 2024, Nasdaq-listed Vision Marine expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.
The Start of a $12-Billion Transition in the Water
From NFL superstar Tom Brady and the first-ever electric boat racing world cup to two history-making VMAR records, the waterways are undergoing a sea change. This is the biggest transition in boating history since the first gasoline-powered outboard motors came on the market in 1896.
The global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031. More specifically, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is poised to reach $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% over the next 8 years. The marine battery market, too, is explosive, and represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.
All the hype isn’t just about climate change, either—though that is the driving impetus. Water-lovers appreciate the absence of extremely noisy gasoline-powered boat motors and enjoy the peaceful quiet of electric, as well as the fact that from a safety perspective, there is no risk of gasoline leakage or carbon monoxide poisoning. Also adding to the attraction is longer-term savings, not just in gasoline, but also in maintenance costs. Electric outboard motors are said to require far less maintenance, making them cheaper overall to operate.
The world is at the beginning of a ~$12-billion transition to electric boats, and Vision Marine Technologies seems to be the frontrunner in this new, fast-moving space, breaking all kinds of records and following a sales strategy that avoids the cash-burn typical of this space.

While Ford's EV Vision Is Taking Longer Than Expected ...,01-Aug-23,Last week Ford Motor (NYSE: F) revealed its EV transformation is set to  bring a ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-fords-ev-vision-taking-153537997.html,"Last week, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) revealed its EV transformation is set to bring a $4.5 billion loss this year, with the legacy automaker increasing its loss estimate despite the increase in EV revenue. Meanwhile, pioneering automotive and energy accessories innovator and maker, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) has revealed today that it has officially kicked off production at its U.S. facility, a week ahead of its scheduled launch date.
Worksport Announces Earlier Than Expected Production Launch
Worksport's $4 million state-of-art manufacturing line is officially in business. This production line will be releasing the company’s soft and hard folding tonneau covers, as this innovative company works towards releasing the eagerly expected solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS which will come after the redesigned COR portable battery system. Worksport already received a node from a major U.S. automotive aftermarket accessories reseller with the first batch of made-in-the-USA hard-folding tonneau covers, indicating a promising start as the company continues its path toward revenue growth.
Ford’s ""Ford Model e"" EV Segment Loss More Than Doubles Compared To Last Year
Ford Model e's revenue rose 39% and the Blue Oval expects to reach an output of 600,000 EVs per year by 2024. But, EV transformation comes at a cost, and a rather big one. Ford previously projected a loss of $3 billion that it now raised to $4.5 billion as it already lost $1.8 billion so far this year. The projected figure is more than twice the 2022’s $2.1 billion loss. During the latest reported quarter, Ford joined forces with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as it agreed to adopt the Tesla charging standard, also gaining access to Tesla’s supercharging network. Ford also followed Tesla strategy-wise as it lowered the price of its electric F-150 pickup. But it has still a long and painful way to go towards the all-electric future.
Worksport’s Revolutionary Technology Could Contribute To A Powershift On The EV Front
Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) is known to be the first automaker whose Santa Cruz will be equipped with Worksport’s proprietary solar-powered technology, and SOLIS just might be the part of the electric pickup equation that could bring a power shift on this EV front. There’s already an ongoing electric pickup war between Tesla Cybertruck who only recently rolled off the production line at the EV maker’s Giga Texas facility, Ford F-150 the Lightning whose price recently got lowered, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN)'s R1T and the upcoming electric Silverado EV pickup truck made by General Motors (NYSE: GM). Meanwhile, although it also entered Tesla’s charging network, Rivian continues to build its own charging network while GM and Hyundai, along with BMW Group, Honda Motor Co (NYSE: HMC), Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group (OTC: MBGYY) and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA, revealed last week they made an alliance to build North America’s leading high-powered charging network. Therefore, the race to catch up to Tesla, the EV King, is on.

Despite significantly beating second-quarter expectations and raising its 2023 guidance, Ford Motor estimates its electric vehicle (EV) division, Ford Model e, will lose $4.5 billion this year. That’s $1.5 billion more than the projected $3 billion, and over twice as much as the section lost in 2022 ($2.1 billion), per Fox Business.

Ford released its second-quarter financial results on July 27, and regardless of what seems like discouraging news regarding its EV branch, revenue from Ford Model e’s first-generation electric vehicles increased 39% in the second quarter, and the company remains decisively optimistic about the future adoption of EVs.
“The near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected, which is going to benefit early movers like Ford,” Ford CEO and president Jim Farley said.
According to the news release, Ford has increased its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $11-$12 billion after global demand for Ford trucks, SUVs and commercial vans drove second-quarter revenue up 12% to $45 billion and generated $1.9 billion in net income.
As Reuters reported, Ford lost more than $32,000 on average per EV issued by Model e during Q2 as it struggled to keep costs down. Meanwhile, the average transaction price for electric vehicles was a lofty $53,438 in June 2023, per Cox Automotive.
However, due to higher operating costs and slower-than-expected adoption, Ford expects to push back EV production objectives, getting to this year’s original target rate of 600,000 sometime during 2024, per Fox Business.

Addressing the challenge ahead, Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said, “We’re not shying away from our EV plans. This is not going to be a straight line. There’s going to be some bumpiness as we move along.”
After overestimating growth in demand, Ford currently has an oversupply of EVs, and while prices are still out of the average car buyer’s reach, the company may decide to cut prices further to stay ahead of the competition.
Last month, Ford slashed prices across its F-150 Lightning electric truck line, citing “increased plant capacity, continued work on scaling production and cost, and improving battery raw material costs,” according to Kelley Blue Book.
Despite the loss numbers, Ford is banking on the gradual widespread adoption of its electric vehicles. “EV customers are brand loyal and we’re winning lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products; we’re making smart investments in capabilities and capacity around the world; and, while others are trying to catch up, we have clean-sheet, next-generation products in advanced development that will blow people away,” said Farley.
We’ll have to wait and see whether the second-largest U.S.-based automaker will blow people away immediately or if adoption process of its Model e vehicles will continue to lag. Third-quarter 2023 financial results are expected to be announced on October 26.

Exxon Mobil in talks with Tesla Ford to supply lithium ...,31-Jul-23,(Reuters) -Oil major Exxon Mobil is in talks with Tesla Ford Motor  Volkswagen ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-mobil-talks-tesla-ford-181722691.html,"(Reuters) -Oil major Exxon Mobil is in talks with Tesla, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other automakers to supply lithium for electric vehicle batteries, Bloomberg Law reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The talks also include the likes of Samsung and SK On Co, the report added.
Tesla, Ford, Volkswagen did not respond to Reuters requests for comment, while Exxon declined to comment.
Any discussions between Exxon and automakers would be very preliminary since Exxon has no way of producing the battery metal.
Reuters reported last month that Exxon had agreed to study ways with Tetra Technologies Inc to develop more than 6,100 acres (24.7 square kilometers) in Arkansas containing lithium-rich brine. Exxon also earlier this year bought more than 100,000 acres in Arkansas from privately-held Galvanic Energy.
Extracting lithium from those brines will require Exxon to chose a direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology, something it has not yet done. Additionally, no DLE technology has ever worked at commercial scale, although multiple companies are racing to be the first.
Reuters also reported last month that Exxon has held talks with International Battery Metals about licensing DLE technology.
Exxon's rapid expansion into the lithium sector comes amid growing interest from traditional energy companies and others into emerging technologies that aim to boost global supply of the ultralight metal.

10 Best Small Cap Automotive Stocks To Buy,31-Jul-23,When investors think about the automotive industry they often consider  major players like Tesla Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the automotive industry, head directly to 5 Best Small Cap Automotive Stocks To Buy. 
In 2023, the automotive industry will remain susceptible to hindrances due to global headwinds. These challenges include the energy crisis, lower automotive demand worldwide, and continuing supply-chain problems. In 2023, new-vehicle sales are projected to remain flat, particularly in Europe and the US. According to the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), global new car sales are expected to increase by just 0.9%, hindered by reduced consumer spending, high commodity prices, and supply-chain disruptions causing production delays. Sales in western Europe are predicted to fall by about 3%, while in North America, they are expected to drop by 2.4%. Additionally, new commercial vehicle sales will also decline globally by 1.3% due to a forecasted recession in the Eurozone and slower GDP growth in the US and China. Overall, new-vehicle sales are anticipated to see marginal growth in 2023, mainly driven by growth in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Despite this, the total global new-vehicle sales of 79 million units in 2023 are expected to lag behind the pre-pandemic levels of 88 million units.

At the end of March 2023, Affinitiv pointed out that the challenges plaguing the automotive industry go beyond just chip shortages, concerns about EV legislation, and technological collaborations. The firm mentioned seven trends to watch in 2023 which would shape the future of the auto industry. Firstly, Affinitiv cited recent studies which show that around 55% of buyers prioritize excellent customer experience over competitive prices when choosing a dealership. Additionally, 75% of customers would increase their dealership visits if the purchasing process were more convenient, while 60% would make quicker purchasing decisions if the process were made more accessible. Secondly, to combat supply chain challenges, it will be beneficial for manufacturers to shift from just-in-time to just-in-case inventory systems in order to boost supplies, even if it means incurring higher inventory costs.
Moreover, to cater to younger audiences, auto manufacturers are expected to integrate voice-activated services, biometric controls, digital cockpits, and 5G capabilities in their vehicles. The shift to EVs is also imperative in the future. Furthermore, Affinitiv observed that approximately 30% of consumers are comfortable buying online, and most car buyers expect dealers to provide permanent online options. However, some buyers are unhappy with initial online experiences due to dealers struggling with low inventory and extended waiting times after pre-orders. To address this, dealers must simplify negotiating and buying processes to prevent potential delays. Affinitiv also noted that about 75% of auto consumers are influenced by online videos when making a purchase decision. Innovative formats like 360-degree videos can sway 65% of consumers to buy a car without a test drive. Therefore, auto manufacturers should display video walkarounds on dealership websites offering potential buyers information equivalent to an in-person viewing experience. Lastly, the firm mentioned that dealerships should adopt AI to improve efficiency and business strategy in 2023, with three primary applications of AI being task automation, using chatbots for customer service, and optimizing advertising efforts.

Forget August's Notorious Past Instead Buy 3 Growth Stocks,03-Aug-23,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-augusts-notorious-past-instead-124600409.html,"Wall Street, time and again, witnessed bouts of volatility in August, which easily disrupted the stock market’s blockbuster performance in the first seven months of this year.
However, the underlying strength in the economy and a possible rate hike pause are largely expected to boost the stock market this August. This calls for investing in growth players like Ford Motor F, Alphabet GOOGL and Block SQ.
August is a Bad Month for Wall Street
Major bourses in the United States recently registered their strongest seven months to begin a year in decades. Per Dow Jones Market Data, the broader S&P 500 witnessed its best first seven-month period in a year since 1997, while the tech-laden Nasdaq wrapped up its strongest performance in the same period since 1975.
But August is here, and that could mean trouble for Wall Street. Lest we forget, the S&P 500’s seven-month winning streak in the year 2021 stopped in August. Morningstar reported that August has been the worst-performing month for stocks since 1986. The month, in reality, marks a volatile period as market participation reduces, leading to lower trading volumes.
So far this August, stocks have hit a selloff after Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term rating for the United States. The debt ceiling turmoil in Washington compelled Fitch to downgrade the United States to AA+ from AAA. The rating agency forecasts the debt burden in the United States to escalate soon and expects a fiscal deterioration in the next three years.
Things May Not be the Same This August
Despite a discouraging start to August, investors are betting on a market revival as they believe the U.S. economy may not slip into a downturn. After all, the second-quarter GDP numbers came in stronger than expected, while orders for durable goods improved in June. To top it, the real-estate industry recently declared that the housing recession has ended.
Meanwhile, retail inflation came in at 3% on a yearly basis in June, way below the 9% peak it touched last year. The slowdown in the prices of indispensable commodities may now force the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive with its monetary policies.
The CME FedWatch Tool at present shows that 82.5% of market pundits expect a rate hike pause in September, as was done in the June meeting. Needless to say, a rate hike pause bodes well for stocks vis-à-vis the economy since it improves consumer outlays, and curtails borrowing costs.
3 Best Growth Stocks to Own in August
Unlike its notorious past, things are surely looking up for the stock market this August. Astute investors, thus, should shrug off the temporary dip in the market and instead place bets on solid growth stocks to boost returns in the near future.
These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.
Ford Motor is one of the leading automakers in the world. An impressive vehicle lineup, including F-series trucks and SUV models, is expected to boost Ford’s top-line growth. Ford’s ample liquidity position is expected to help the company in further investments.
F has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s current-year earnings has moved up 17.8% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9%. Ford’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 7%.
Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Momentum in its cloud business and efforts to strengthen its position in the growing wearable space should improve Alphabet’s profit margin.
GOOGL has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alphabet’s current-year earnings has moved up 4.3% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.7%. Alphabet’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 15.3%.
Block provides financial and marketing services through its all-inclusive commerce ecosystem that aids sellers to begin, run and grow their businesses. Its ever-expanding customer base, coupled with strong Cash App engagement, is benefiting Block, formerly known as Square.
SQ has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block’s next-year earnings has moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69%. Block’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 20.2%.
Shares of Ford Motor, Alphabet and Block have gained 12.1%, 45.5% and 18.5%, respectively, so far this year.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.
Rivian downgraded ahead of Q2
Electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) saw shares fall more than 1% Tuesday, with a 4% premarket slump Wednesday, after Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded the company to a Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $29.00 (from $27.00).
The downgrade came on valuation - shares have rocketed nearly 50% year to date - as well as ""increased competition"" in the EV space from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on Aug 8. Street estimates stand at ($1.43) for EPS and $1 billion for revenues.
ZoomInfo’s rating cut at two firms following Q2 miss
ZoomInfo Technologies (NASDAQ:ZI) was downgraded by two Wall Street firms after the company reported worse-than-expected Q2 revenue and guidance, which resulted in a share price drop of nearly 27% yesterday.
Deutsche Bank downgraded the company to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $20.00 from $31.00.
The analyst said that, while there is a sense that the company may be nearing a bottom and the lowered 2023 guidance accounts for further deterioration, concerns remain about management's lack of visibility and the stock's multiple, which the analyst says carries downside risk.
Wolfe Research downgraded the company to Peerperform from Outperform.
After multiple cuts to guidance, and macro headwinds not dissipating for the foreseeable (at least three more quarters) future, we believe shares stay range-bound for as investors digest a HSD/LDD top line growth profile with contracting FCF margins that we don't see returning to 40% until after 2025.
Shares were down another 1.3% in premarket trading.
Crestwood Equity received two downgrades
Crestwood Equity Partners (NYSE:CEQP) was hit with two downgrades following the company’s reported Q2 results, highlighted by revenue and adjusted EBITDA miss. As a result, shares dropped more than 5% yesterday.
JPMorgan cut the company to Underweight from Neutral and cut its price target to $28.00 from $30.00.
Given the limited total return potential to our new PT and recent quarterly EBITDA misses, we see CEQP in the 'show me camp' for a period of time.
Meanwhile, RBC Capital lowered the stock to Sector Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $27.00 from $29.00.
Electronic Arts cut to Neutral
UBS downgraded Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $142.00 (from $140.00) following Q1 results, as reported in real time on InvestingPro. As a result, shares dropped more than 4% premarket today.

EV startups burn through more cash as demand falters,03-Aug-23,The squeeze has already claimed its first casualty in electric truck maker  Lordstown Motors which filed for bankruptcy in June. Companies including  Lucid and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-startups-burn-more-cash-162148682.html,"By Akash Sriram
(Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle startups are expected to show the impact of Tesla's price war when they report quarterly results over the next few days, with investors awaiting details on how the companies are managing cash amid a funding drought.
Even market leader Tesla has warned of ""turbulent times"" and traditional automakers with deeper pockets including Ford Motor are losing money on EVs. The squeeze has already claimed its first casualty in electric truck maker Lordstown Motors, which filed for bankruptcy in June.
Companies including Lucid and Nikola are likely to report another quarter of steep cash burn, as they continue to struggle with production and demand.
""The only ones that have a chance besides Musk are the legacy auto providers and so far they are proving that they are losing money hand over fist trying to get into the EV game,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital. Hayes follows the EV industry closely but holds no shares.
The one standout seems to be Amazon-backed Rivian Automotive, which is likely to report a three-fold surge in revenue to $983.1 million for the April-June quarter.
The company's cash outflow likely slowed to $1.19 billion in the second quarter, down by about $600 million from the January-March period, according to 13 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Gross margins likely improved to a negative 51.3% from negative 58.6%.
""Rivian's competitive advantages are shining brighter, with the company emerging as a demand creator when considering that the majority of its buyers have never previously purchased a pickup truck,"" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said.
At least 8 analysts have raised their price target on the company's stock, which has gained about 40% so far this year.
Lucid, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is expected to report deepening losses on Monday after it reported a fall in April-June production due to supply-chain problems.
It is set to post a cash balance of $2.76 billion for the April-June period, up from $900 million in the prior three months, after it announced a fundraise of about $3 billion, according to six analysts polled by Visible Alpha.
Nikola, which reiterated a going-concern warning in May, is expected to report a 15% decline in revenue and widening losses on Friday.
Its shares have rallied nearly 40% this year as the company attempts to reduce its cash burn with layoffs and the liquidation of a recently acquired battery business. However, that may still not be enough to meet its funding needs, analysts have said.
Fisker, which has healthy cash reserves and an aggressive profitability goal, is expected to report on Friday its first revenue from vehicle sales after the firm started deliveries of its Ocean SUVs in the June quarter.

Ford Motor Company (F) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here ...,11-Aug-23,Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo Finance  Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us · Terms  and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-attracting-130012575.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -20%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has lost 9.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +20.7%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.05 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. This estimate has changed +14.8% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.88 indicates a change of -8% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.1%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ford Motor Company is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.36 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.85 billion and $157.01 billion estimates indicate +6.6% and -1.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $42.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.09 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.83%. The EPS surprise was +41.18%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

5 Lucrative Value Picks Based on Discounted PEG
In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register more than 20% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2022. This favorably compares with a 10% rise of the S&P 500 Index during the same period.
Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Alibaba Group, Encompass Health, Molson Coors Beverage, Ford Motor and Albemarle Corp.
More on Value Investing
While searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales and price/book value (P/B).
This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.
However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.
In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.
The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate
A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.
While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.
There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.
Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.
Here are the five out of the 27 stocks that qualified the screening:
Alibaba: It is one of the leading e-commerce giants in China. Over the last few years, the company has transformed itself from being a traditional e-commerce company to a conglomerate that has businesses ranging from logistics and food delivery to cloud computing.Alibaba Group is currently represented by three businesses — Alibaba.com, Taobao and Tmall.
Alibaba currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. Alibaba also has an impressive five-year expected growth rate of 19.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Encompass Health: It is a provider of integrated healthcare services. It offers facility-based patient care through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. With a national footprint that includes 158 hospitals across 36 states and Puerto Rico, the company delivers high-quality, cost-effective, integrated care in the healthcare space.
Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Encompass Health currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Encompass Health has a long-term expected growth rate of 11.8%.
Molson Coors: It is a global manufacturer and seller of beer and other beverage products. It has an impressive and diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands. These include global priority brands such as Blue Moon, Miller Lite, CoorsBanquet, Coors Light, Miller Genuine Draft and Staropramen as well as regional champion brands like Carling, Molson Canadian.

Ford exec expects software to boost revenue for commercial ...,10-Aug-23,... Ford Motor Company World Headquarters in Dearborn More. By Paul Lienert  ... Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-exec-expects-software-boost-161646425.html,"By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Ford Motor expects to incorporate more and better software into the trucks and vans in its highly profitable Ford Pro commercial vehicle business and grow revenues by $4,000-$5,000 per vehicle in the future, a top executive said on Thursday.
Navin Kumar, chief financial officer of Ford Pro, said the automaker would look to boost revenue with software- and data-driven fleet services, safety and security services, partial vehicle autonomy and insurance.
Kumar, speaking at a J.P. Morgan investor conference, did not give a percentage forecast for revenue or profit margin growth, but said Ford’s ability to deliver and profit from those services will be enhanced in the middle of this decade when the company introduces its next-generation electric commercial vehicles with a new digital “intelligence” platform.
That new platform will help Ford Pro meet some ambitious 2026 targets, he said, including doubling the percentage of connected vehicles to about 60% and tripling the percentage of vehicles with paid software to about 36%.
Ford Pro will continue to offer a full portfolio of combustion engine, hybrid electric and full electric vehicles, Kumar said.
Its second-generation EVs, including the successor to the F-150 Lightning pickup, will be more profitable, in terms of their ability to generation additional software and services revenue.
Kumar said the current F-150 Lightning was not “cost optimized,” but declined to say whether it was profitable.
He said Ford Pro expects to boost its commercial vehicle business in Europe with the arrival this fall of a new Transit Custom van and the introduction next year of electric versions of the Transit Courier and Transit Custom.

3 Auto Stocks to Buy for Growth & Value
Several auto stocks appear to be trading at bargain territory considering the broader sectors strengthening prospects.
The combination of easing inflation and expansion among the EV market makes these top-rated auto stocks compelling in regards to growth.
Better still, is that their valuations are very attractive at their current levels making now an ideal time to buy.
General Motors: It certainly looks like an ideal time to invest in General Motors with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
After impressively beating second-quarter top and bottom line expectations in late July, General Motors’ stock still appears to be overlooked. General Motors’ annual earnings are now expected to be virtually flat this year and dip -5% in FY24 at $7.17 per share but this would still represent 46% EPS growth over the last five years.
Even better, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher since the company’s Q2 report which is a strong indication that GM stock should have more upside ahead. Plus, General Motors stock trades at just 4.7X forward earnings with the rising EPS estimates supporting the notion that GM shares are cheap.
Ford Motor: Along with General Motors, Ford’s stock is worthy of investors’ consideration at the moment and currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Ford also blasted Q2 expectations in late July with earnings projected to rise 9% this year at $2.05 per share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to drop -8% after what would be a tougher to compete-against year. However, FY24 EPS projections of $1.88 per share would represent a very stellar 358% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $0.41 a share.
Furthermore, EPS estimates have remained higher over the last 30 days and Ford stock trades at 6.2X forward earnings. This is an attractive discount to its industry average of 11X and the S&P 500’s 20.9X.
Honda Motor Co: Throwing a foreign automaker in the mix, Honda’s stock looks attractive with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Honda most recently crushed its fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations on Thursday. Earnings of $1.60 per share crushed Q1 estimates of $0.99 a share by 61% with sales of $33.69 billion topping estimates of $33.56 billion.
Annual earnings are anticipated to soar 33% in Honda’s current fiscal 2024 to $4.04 per share. Plus, FY25 earnings are expected to rise another 3%. Earnings estimates have remained higher and could continue to go up following Honda’s strong Q1 results. This also makes Honda stock look attractive at 7.9X forward earnings which is roughly on par with its own industry average and well below the benchmark.
Bottom Line
Investors will not want to overlook these automakers as their growth stories and valuations are very attractive. To that point, General Motors, Ford, and Honda stock appear to be poised for more upside in 2023 and remain viable long-term investments as well.

Changan Ford Motor to set up electric car JV with Chongqing ...,11-Aug-23,Changan Ford is a 50-50 joint venture between Ford Motor Co and Changan  Automobile ... Yahoo Finance. Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power  gaming and AI...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/changan-ford-motor-set-jv-144847303.html,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Changan Ford Motor plans to set up a new-energy passenger car joint venture with state-owned Chongqing Changan Automobile, a document published by China's market regulator on Friday showed.
Changan Ford Motor will own a 60% stake and Chongqing Changan Automobile the remaining 40% stake. Changan Ford is a 50-50 joint venture between Ford Motor Co and Changan Automobile, meaning Chongqing Changan will own more than 50% of the new venture.
In the future, the joint venture plans to engage in the ""supply business of mainstream brand new energy passenger vehicles and the distribution business of Ford brand models that Changan Ford has invested in,"" the statement said. Ford said in a later statement the new venture also will sell existing Ford-brand gas-powered vehicles.
Ford said the venture was being formed ""to better grasp the development trend of electrification and intelligence in the auto industry.""
Asked whether this new venture means Ford is minimizing its exposure in China, spokesman Anderson Chan said it was aligned with CEO Jim Farley's strategy that includes leaning into the strength of the company's partners in China. The company said it would provide further details later.
Farley said last month during the company's earnings conference call that the U.S. automaker may have to use its local partners' vehicle platforms more ""in certain segments,"" excluding pickups and large SUVs.
Changan officials could not be reached for further comment.
Sales of Ford with Changan fell 12.6% in the first half form the year-ago period, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data showed.
More than 40 brands have cut prices in China since January after an initial move by Tesla in a fight for market share in the world's biggest auto market, as car demand slumps, with ripples spreading through the wider industry.

Pick These Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio
Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.
There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Corebridge Financial, Inc., General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Magna International Inc. boast low P/CF ratios.
This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.
Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.
Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.
However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.
Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:
Corebridge Financial, which provides retirement solutions and insurance products, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 23.5% for three to five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.3%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corebridge Financial’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 23% and 45.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Corebridge Financial has a Value Score of A. The stock has decreased 10.9% in the past year.
General Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.9% for three to five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.6%, on average.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ current financial year sales suggests growth of 9% from the year-ago period. General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have declined 5.7% in the past year.
Ford Motor, which designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 7% for three to five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.1%, on average.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford Motor’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.6% and 9%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Ford Motor has a Value Score of A. The stock has decreased 19.6% in the past year.
Magna International, one of the world’s largest suppliers in the automotive space, carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 20.4% for three to five years. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 20% in the last reported quarter.

In the twilight of the muscle car era demand for the new 486 ...,11-Aug-23,Associated Press Finance. August 11 2023 ·2 min read. FILE - Bill Ford  executive chairman of Ford Motor Company introduces one of the models of  the 2024 Ford...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twilight-muscle-car-era-demand-154309511.html,"DETROIT (AP) — New versions of the Mustang muscle car will begin shipping next week and more than two thirds of the orders include the big, 5-liter V-8 engine, Ford said Friday.
Demand for roaring engines remains strong in an era when Detroit automakers are starting to phase out the rumbling gas burners and transition to electric vehicles in order to meet strict government emissions and fuel economy requirements.
There are about 13,000 U.S. orders for the 2024 Mustangs, Ford says, which also can be equipped with a four-cylinder turbocharged engine. Of those orders, 67% have the V-8, and more than a quarter of the people seeking that Mustang want the six-speed manual transmission, spokesman Mike Levine says.
But muscle cars, at least new ones, are on their way out.
General Motors announced in March that it will stop making the Chevrolet Camaro early next year as a 2024 model. The company wouldn't rule out a replacement for the Camaro at a future date.
Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, will stop making gas versions of the Dodge Challenger and Charger muscle cars by the end of this year. But the company has plans to roll out a battery-powered Charger performance car sometime in 2024.
Levine wouldn't say whether this version of the Mustang would be the company's last gas-powered muscle car. “That remains to be seen,” he said.
There also could be an electric Mustang sports car in the future. Electric cars, with instant torque and a low center of gravity, often are faster and handle better than internal combustion vehicles.
People are going for V-8 Mustangs with stick shifts in part because they may be the last of the gas-powered muscle car era, said Guidehouse Insights eMobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid.
“The most hard-core fans, they're going to go out and grab one of these because you don’t know when it’s going to end,” he said.
When a new Mustang comes out, the V-8 order rate is almost always higher than the other available engines, as is the demand for manual transmissions, because fervent Mustang fans are often the first to order, Abuelsamid said.
“We tend to see more demand from enthusiasts for the V-8 whenever an all-new Mustang is introduced,” Jim Owens, Mustang brand manager, said in a prepared statement.
The new Mustang, which is on the same underpinnings as the current version, is built at a factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, south of Detroit. Most of the V-8s will produce 486 horsepower, but a Dark Horse version puts out 500.","{'negative': 0.6286678910255432, 'neutral': 0.8004924058914185, 'positive': 0.8263362646102905}",0.8004924058914185,0.8263362646102905,0.6286678910255432
5 Broker-Loved Stocks to Watch Amid the Current Volatility,10-Aug-23,In fact broker-friendly stocks like CVR Energy CVI Ford Motor Company F  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-broker-loved-stocks-watch-123100062.html,"Market volatility in the United States, which has been prevalent since the beginning of the current month, has kept investors on edge. After a breather in June, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points at its July meeting, reminding investors that inflation is still a force to reckon with. In another alarming development for the U.S. banking industry, Moody’s Investors Service recently downgraded 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks and put six bigger lenders under review for a potential downgrade.
The rating agency stated that factors like elevated funding costs, potential regulatory capital weakness and heightened risks pertaining to commercial real estate loans on subdued office space demand were hurting banks’ profitability.
However, this gloomy scenario does not mean that investors should dodge stocks. In fact, broker-friendly stocks like CVR Energy CVI, Ford Motor Company F, Telephone and Data Systems TDS, Beazer Homes USA BZH and Flex FLEX are worth keeping on one’s radar for healthy returns despite this turbulence.
Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), conduct thorough research of the stocks under their coverage. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers indulge in extensive research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise.
Therefore, adhering to brokers’ well-researched information is of paramount importance, particularly in uncertain times such as the present scenario. This is because it is next to impossible for individual investors to keep track of the market nuances amid such economic upheavals and design a winning basket of stocks.
To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving broker recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.
However, designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to lead to a winning approach. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.
Screening Criteria
# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75 (This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).
% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10 (This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter).
We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one:
Price-to-Sales = Bot%10 (The lower the ratio. the better. Companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio).
Price greater than 5 (as a stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors).
Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days (Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded).
Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000 (This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization).
Com/ADR/Canadian= Com (This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks).
Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:
CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit is supporting growth.
CVR Energy, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 28.75%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 27.84% over the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Ford’s vehicle lineup, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, combined with a robust electric vehicle lineup, should drive growth. The company’s investor-friendly attitude is commendable as well.
Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17.8% upward over the past 60 days.
Telephone and Data Systems is being well-served by factors like cost-saving initiatives, fiber fortification programs, network infrastructure advancement and steady 5G development. The company has been focusing on business services like cloud-based backup services and managed IP connections.
TDS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings being revised 9.6% upward over the past 60 days.
Beazer Homes USA is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The homebuilder specializes in the design, construction and sale of single-family and multi-family residences. BZH offers a variety of housing options under the names Beazer Homes, Gatherings and Choice Plans.
The company’s shares have gained 153.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 53% growth in the same timeframe. BZH’s earnings topped the consensus mark in the last four quarters, the average being 29.8%. Currently, Beazer Homes sports a Zacks Rank #1.
Flex is benefiting from investments in infrastructure and expanded capacity despite supply-chain and macroeconomic headwinds. This Singapore-based company is being well-served by strength across Agility Solutions and Reliability Solutions segments.
Flex currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. FLEX’s earnings topped the consensus mark in the last four quarters, the average being 12.6%.

PAGS. 5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in August.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-ford-094200503.html,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – August 15, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are Ford Motor Co. F, General Motors Co. GM, NOV Inc NOV, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. PAGS.
5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in August
While there are a host of valuation metrics, the first to cross one's mind is the price-to-earnings ratio. However, in the case of loss-making companies, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is negative. In such a scenario, price-to-sales (P/S) could indicate the hidden strength of the business.
The price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.
The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.
The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., NOV Inc, StoneCo Ltd. and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. are some such stocks.
Now let us understand the concept of book value.
Understanding Book Value?
Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.
It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.
Understanding P/B Ratio
By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.
A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.
For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.
But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.
Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.
In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.

Ford CEO: It's the 'right time' to build the Mustang GTD supercar,19-Aug-23,Yahoo. Advertisement. Yahoo Finance. Ford CEO: It's the 'right time ... —  Ford Motor Company (F) has made supercars before — like the Ford GT that...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-its-the-right-time-to-build-the-mustang-gtd-supercar-132431166.html,"MONTEREY, Calif. — Ford Motor Company (F) has made supercars before — like the Ford GT that took on Ferrari at Le Mans — and won. Now the automaker is taking the supercar recipe to its everyday Mustang pony car, featuring supercharged performance and a supercar price of around $300,000.
The Mustang GTD, just debuted at Monterey Car Week, is basically the company's Mustang GT3 race car, for the road — but it’s even more hardcore than the race car, if you can believe it. Ford says the GTD is powered by its most powerful V8 ever, a version of the GT500’s “Predator” 5.2 Liter supercharged V8, producing around 800 horsepower. In order to keep a preferred 50/50 weight distribution, Ford is using a rear transaxle, a first for a road-going Mustang, which will house an 8-speed dual clutch transmission.
""We didn't want Aston Martin and Mercedes and Porsche to have all the fun with their cars,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley tells Yahoo Finance from the Quail event here at Monterey Car Week. ""And we think it's kind of the right time for us to build Mustang at the higher end, the $300,000 range.""
The Mustang GTD at the Quail event (credit: Pras Subramanian) (Pras Subramanian)
Also a first for a road-going Mustang, the GTD will use the rear trunk space to house its all-new rear suspension and spring setup. Seen in race cars and super exotic road cars, the GTD was given an “integral link pushrod and rocker arm architecture,” where the car’s active shock absorbers and coil over springs are arranged in a horizontal cross pattern. It’s a very trick, race car setup, and definitely does not come cheap.
Indeed, this is no ordinary Mustang. While Ford wants to show the world what the company can do on the racetrack, the question becomes what buyers are willing to shell out $300,000 for a car that looks similar and is somewhat based on the $30,000 Mustang pony car.
That may be a question for another day, as the GTD, which for now is slotted in as a 2025 model year car, will be built in such a small quantity that it will likely be highly sought after among car enthusiasts.

Farley also discussed the latest on the company's electrification efforts, which see production improving, but profits at this point still hard to come by.
""The [Model] e business, the volume is ok. We spent the first half getting ready to triple production in the fourth quarter, but the profitability is really challenged,"" Farley said. ""Thankfully, the other two businesses make more than enough to make up for that challenge, but what we're seeing with [Model] e is that people just love the cars, but they don't want to pay premium.""
Farley has been driving around the country in a Ford Lightning EV, trying to see what it's like to live day in, day out with an EV. He believes most of the issues we face with the EV transformation are human issues — like planning, range anxiety, and things like that — but that doesn't mean systems like the nation's charging infrastructure don't need improvement.
Another big challenge facing Ford are the current talks with the UAW, where the current contract expires in less than 30 days. The rhetoric has been heating up on the union side, and automaker industry execs believe the union's demands are too extreme.
""It's a really difficult discussion; to be frank, we're far apart,"" Farley says. Ford has much at stake as it has 20% more US workers than GM and Stellantis, but he is hopeful a deal can be struck. ""I believe that Ford and the [UAW] will find a way forward to guarantee a future for our manufacturing base in the country. And for the middle class, we have a lot of work to do in the next 30 days.""
And those workers, after a deal is struck, will be building cars like the $300,000 Mustang GTD. And debuting the car at the Quail event, during Monterey Car Week, in Farley's mind is the right place for it — and its well-heeled attendees.
""We've never made a Mustang in this kind of price zone, and this is the right crowd — we want to sell $300,000 Mustangs, you got to be at the Quail, right?,"" Farley says. ""This is the right place — just like maybe a football game is the right place for an F-150 — this is the right place for this car.""

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor Company, recently went on a road trip in an F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the automaker’s popular F-150 pickup truck. During the test drive, Farley experienced firsthand the challenges of driving an electric truck, especially when its battery runs low, and he’s not coy about it.
Earlier this month, Farley and a few Ford employees embarked on a 620-mile trip from Silicon Valley to Las Vegas through Los Angeles along U.S. Route 66. The F-150 Lightning has a driving range between 230 miles and 320 miles, depending on the version, so he had to recharge the truck a few times on the way. When Farley stopped at a popular charging station in Coalinga, Calif., about 200 miles south of San Francisco, he hooked his truck up to a low-speed charger for 40 minutes and found that it only juiced the vehicle’s battery up to 40 percent.
“Charging has been pretty challenging,” Farley said in a video he posted on X and LinkedIn over the weekend. “It was a really good reality check of what challenges our customers are going through and the importance of fast charging.”
In May, Ford became one of the first carmakers to ink a deal with Tesla (TSLA) to give its EV customers access to Tesla’s network of more than 12,000 Superchargers in North America. A Tesla Supercharger can boost a vehicle’s battery to 80 percent in less than 20 minutes, while a regular EV charger, like the one Farly used in Coalinga, may take a few hours. Long charging time and range anxiety, or fear that a car runs out of power before reaching its destination or a charging station, are among the top reasons Americans are still slow to adopt EVs. Currently, fast chargers are sporadic, and Tesla’s charging network—albeit the largest in the country—requires a special plug and is incompatible with non-Tesla vehicles. Under its partnership with Tesla, Ford will provide its EV customers with an adaptor to use Tesla Superchargers and begin installing Tesla-standard charging ports in its EVs in 2025.
The partnership “will help us improve the EV experience for our customers,” Farley wrote in a tweet on August 13.
At least seven other carmakers, including General Motors, Volvo and Nissan, have signed similar deals with Tesla, hoping access to a larger charging network will boost their EV sales. Ford has billed the F-150 Lightning as an all-purpose vehicle that’s not only gas-free but can serve as a power source on the go for off-the-grid situations like a family camping trip or a power outage.
“Long hauling in an electric truck is an act of pioneerism, not because it’s hard or dangerous, but because it’s a new way to experience America,” Farley wrote in a LinkedIn post on August 7 before his road trip. “Shifting from fueling stations to charging stations requires new behaviors and opens new possibilities.”
No surprise charging can be a challenge, but still learning a lot seeing firsthand the issues our customers face. This is why we’re working w/ @Tesla to provide @Ford drivers access to +12,000 superchargers & our EV certified dealers are installing fast chargers at their… pic.twitter.com/fES15o9orT

Growth Factors
Despite the market’s recent weak development, it is anticipated that light commercial vehicle sales would go up overall, particularly in developing nations. In the upcoming years, growth in the market for light commercial vehicles is predicted to be boosted by digitization and increased infrastructure expenditure.
Light commercial vehicle sales are increasing globally for several reasons, including the quick rise in population and urbanization, the development of infrastructure, and the expansion of the industrial sector. Construction, mining, and tourism are just a few of the industries that are growing along with the industrial sector, particularly in emerging nations.
Jobs are more readily available, which has boosted commuting traffic and raised demand for public transportation. E-commerce and digital transformation both significantly contribute to the growth of the transportation and logistics industry. Infrastructure development is being aided by rising industry. In order to advance the transportation and logistics industries in regions, governments are also spending a significant amount on building road infrastructure.
Due to the expansion of the transportation network, as well as strong roads and connections, the tourist sector is also growing. The demand for rental cars has increased over the past several years due to the trend of destination weddings and other events. The building and mining sectors have benefited from urbanization.
Moreover, the e-commerce is another driver boosting the sales of the light commercial vehicles during the forecast period. The freight carriers handle the shipment of goods from merchants to customers of these e-commerce platforms.
The e-commerce sector also makes use of third-party logistics services to manage and watch over the supply chains of e-commerce businesses, allowing these businesses to concentrate on marketing and other company activities. Several light commercial trucks are used by these third-party logistic companies, including FedEx, XPO Logistics, and DHL, to transport the cargo to the closest product delivery point.
Due to the fact that smaller LCVs are more fuel-efficient than heavier commercial vehicles while driving within a city, these businesses have a greater fleet of LCVS. Additionally, the adoption of effective light commercial vehicles in the e-commerce industry is growing at a substantial rate due to the multiple benefits offered by various vehicle manufacturers to freight transporters, which is fueling the growth of the light commercial vehicle market.

Dublin, Aug. 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Leasing Global Market Report 2023"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Internet of things technology is widely being used by car rental and leasing companies to maintain and manage fleets. The Internet of things is a network of internet-connected objects or devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors. Using IoT technology, car leasing companies can access odometer and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) in real time which facilitates fleet maintenance. This technology is also being used by car rental companies to check fuel level information at the point of car return, eliminating the need for staff to check fuel levels manually.
Furthermore, virtual key solutions for locking and unlocking doors help avoid the management of a large number of physical keys. For example, car rental firm Hertz is implementing IoT technology to provide keyless car rental services and manage its fleet to reduce costs.

The emergence of startups as major clients of leasing service providers is expected to drive the market. Driven by cost efficiency and the necessity to acquire advanced equipment which is often high-priced, startups have started renting or leasing their equipment. The increasing number of startups is also expected to positively impact the market.
The global leasing market grew from $1519.9 billion in 2022 to $1674.39 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2%. The leasing market is expected to grow to $2424.62 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 9.7%.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vietnamese-electric-carmaker-now-worth-071917503.html,"One of Vietnam’s biggest automakers has made a big splash on its entry to Wall Street, pushing its market capitalization above that of industry giants such as Volkswagen and Ford.
VinFast, an electric vehicle maker, enjoyed a red-hot debut in New York on Tuesday after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Black Spade Acquisition Co.
Shares of the newly combined company skyrocketed 270% on the Nasdaq on their first day of trade. They opened at $22, more than double the initial price of $10, and closed at $37 apiece.
The surge propelled VinFast’s market cap above $85 billion. That’s more than Volkswagen (VLKAF) or Ford (F), which are valued at 63.9 billion euros ($69.7 billion) and $48 billion, respectively, according to Refinitiv.
The eye-popping rally, however, was based on thin trade. VinFast is still 99% owned by Vietnam’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, through shares held by his other company Vingroup and other business entities, according to a regulatory filing.
VinFast began trading on the Nasdaq Tuesday. - VinFast/Handout
Vuong, the chairman of both Vingroup and VinFast, saw his own wealth soar by approximately $39 billion on Tuesday as shares of the carmaker shot up, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. He is now estimated to be worth about $44.3 billion.
VinFast was founded in 2017 as a subsidiary of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates. The firm makes electric SUVs, scooters and buses, which are sold in Vietnam and North America.
Its performance Tuesday makes VinFast the largest US-listed Vietnamese company by market cap, it said.
In a statement, CEO Thuy Le said: “It is our hope that VinFast’s listing will inspire and unleash greater opportunities for Vietnamese brands to participate in the global market.”
Chilly US reception
So far, the company has released four electric vehicle models and delivered roughly 19,000 vehicles, according to its prospectus. For comparison, Volkswagen sold 4.4 million vehicles just in the first six months of 2023, more than 321,000 of which were electric.
VinFast is a household name in Vietnam, where its cars have become bestsellers and have access to an extensive charging network across more than 60 cities and provinces.
But the Vietnamese newcomer has had less success in the United States, where it started delivering to customers earlier this year.
In recent months, VinFast has been hit by poor reviews about its electric SUV, the VF 8, after letting US reporters test drive the vehicle.

Several headlines have been particularly blunt, with one by industry outlet Road & Track calling the vehicle “simply unacceptable.” Another by MotorTrend read: “Return to sender.”
Other reviews were more forgiving. One reminded readers that it was the company’s first effort at a car for the US market. Another praised the power delivery from the SUV’s electric motors.
In a blog post earlier this week, VinFast said it has made software improvements based on feedback “from vehicle owners and the automotive reviewer community.”
VinFast has made no secret of its global ambitions. In July, it broke ground on a new factory in North Carolina, which it hopes to use as a base for US sales. The company says the facility may eventually reach capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year.
The company has also teased a Europe launch, telling shareholders it will enter the region “soon.”
In her statement Tuesday, Le suggested the company will use the new proceeds raised to fuel its expansion, saying its listing “unlocks access to the capital markets and important avenues for future development.”
VinFast is not profitable yet. It reported a loss of $1.4 billion for the nine months through last September. It also carried about $2.5 billion in debt as of the end of September, according to a regulatory filing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly down about 0.5%, or 180 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down nearly 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 1% for a second straight day.
Target took center stage Wednesday morning as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook and issued a warning about general economic malaise.
The company cited rising interest rates and uncertainty from the restart of student loan repayments as factors that may continue to affect its bottom line. However, the stock jumped more than 3% as it revealed a profit jump.
In the afternoon, minutes from the Fed's meeting last month showed most officials still see upside risks to inflation while a ""couple"" of officials didn't want to raise rates in July. The central bank raised interest rates to their highest point since 2001 at that meeting.
Investors were looking for any clues as to what the Fed might do at its meeting next month. At this point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, nearly 90% of traders expect the bank to hold rates steady, a slight dip from before the release of the minutes.

Target (TGT) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/legacy-automakers-hitting-speed-bumps-150519025.html,"While Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) beat second quarter estimates and raised 2023 production guidance last week, legacy automakers revealed they have hit speed bumps on their EV route. On Thursday, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) postponed the launch of the all-electric Ford Explorer from the initially planned early 2024 to the summer of 2024. Also on Thursday, General Motors (NYSE: GM) revealed it is still having issues on the Ultium battery front which are slowing down its EV production. Meanwhile, EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) just revealed today it has again cut prices in China, making it even harder for others to catch up.
Ford Is Facing EV Setbacks
The EV that will debut on the European market next summer will be built on a platform of Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) in Germany. Ford already revealed its EV segment is slated for a loss of $4.5 billion this year which is $1.5 billion more than initially expected. Ford CFO John Lawler also did not provide an exact date for the 2 million EV annual output that was previously targeted for 2026.
General Motors Is Also Having EV Struggles
Reuters reported that GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated on an investor conference that the company’s EV output has been slowed down due to production issues of its new Ultium battery packs that the automaker is co-producing with LG Energy Solution Ltd. Upon the warning battery news, GM shares tanked almost 6% on Thursday to their lowest level in more than two months. From January to June, GM manufactured only 50,000 EVs and the majority of them used the older battery pack. GM already missed its production targets last year. The most recent battery setback will mostly impact the production of the Cadillac Lyriq.
Tesla Cuts Prices In China, Yet Again
Just as price tensions started showing signs of abating, Tesla has once again struck by rekindling the price war. According to a post on its Weibo account, Tesla has lowered the prices of the Long Range and Performance versions of the Model Y by about $1,900. It seems that price competitiveness remains an ongoing theme in the Chinese EV universe. Upon news, Tesla stock dropped 1.7% in early US trading, while the stock of its greatest rival in China, the country’s best-selling automaker BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) tanked as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong. Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) also slumped. This move is Tesla reacting upon its July report that showed a slowdown in orders due to the lack of new models to attract buyers with the shipments from its China facility tanking 31% to the lowest level this year. Tesla announced to be making the revamped version of the Model 3 sedan at the facility, but it did not offer any specifics. Meanwhile, BYD, Li Auto and Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) have set new records on the shipment front in July. Early last month, Tesla and BYD, among others, pledged to maintain fair competition and therefore, stay away from abnormal pricing in the country, but the agreement was retracted only days later due to antitrust concerns.
All in all, it seems that has the weapon that Tesla used, the price cuts, did its job of crushing its EV competitors.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the UAW's demands and the potential impact of the new contract on the auto industry.
Video Transcript
RACHELLE AKUFFO: Contract negotiations between the big 3 auto companies-- General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis-- and the union group, United Auto Workers, continue to flail, pointing to a greater likelihood of a strike within the next month. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian to discuss the latest developments. Hey, Pras.
PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Rachelle. The UAW leader Shawn Fain striking a combative tone as negotiations roll on. A few weeks back, Fain outlined some of these demands publicly, which is usually not how things are done, kind of saying that they want to fight. So what do they exactly want? Among other things, they want substantial wage increases, ending the compensation tiers between older and younger workers, cost-of-living adjustments, and defined pension plan, to name a few.
Now, I spoke to a Detroit industry source who was alarmed by some of these demands. The source tells Yahoo Finance, quote, ""Everyone understands these demands aren't going to happen-- it would be suicidal for these companies to agree to this."" ""The 10 demands add up to $25 billion to $30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract."" And finally, ""The impact would be crippling, returning automakers to the bankruptcy era of 2008.""
So for its part, the UAW responds to these things and says, studies show that labor accounts for only 5% of the cost of making a car, and the biggest drivers for car prices for consumers is actually dealer markups. Bottom line, both sides look like they aren't going to back down, meaning a work stoppage, Rachelle, is looking more and more likely.","{'negative': 0.8581839799880981, 'neutral': 0.791639968752861}",0.791639968752861,,0.8581839799880981

A plethora of automakers, including Ford Motor and General Motors, are moving away from the standard Combined Charging System (CCS) connector to Tesla's previously proprietary charging design, which is set to dominate the industry.
Fisker said its vehicles made 2025 onwards will have the NACS port for charging, while other customers can use an adapter to access Tesla's 12,000-strong network of public fast chargers in the U.S. and Canada.
The company will continue to provide an adapter for the CCS if customers wish to continue using the technology, the EV maker said.
Tesla's recent deals represent major strides in displacing a rival standard, CCS, that earlier exclusively had the backing of President Joe Biden's administration.
The government is offering $7.5 billion in funding to speed the deployment of EV chargers in the United States.
Most automakers have shied away from building large charging networks as installing and maintaining chargers requires a substantial investment for still-limited returns.

Is Trending Stock Ford Motor Company (F) a Buy Now?,22-Aug-23,While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a  company's financial ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-ford-motor-company-215317031.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this company have returned -14.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Ford Motor Company belongs, has lost 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share, indicating a change of +33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.11 points to a change of +12.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +18.2%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.94 indicates a change of -7.7% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.6%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.21 billion and $158.5 billion estimates indicate +7.5% and -1.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $42.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.09 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.83%. The EPS surprise was +41.18%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford ...,23-Aug-23,Ford Motor is the latest of several top automakers including Toyota and  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-electric-hybrid-vehicles-boost-180832454.html,"By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles may not be dying as fast as some predicted in the auto sector’s rush to develop all-electric models.
Ford Motor is the latest of several top automakers, including Toyota and Stellantis, planning to build and sell hundreds of thousands of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. over the next five years, industry forecasters told Reuters.
The companies are pitching hybrids as an alternative for retail and commercial customers who are seeking more sustainable transportation, but may not be ready to make the leap to a full electric vehicle.
""Hybrids really serve a lot of America,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at New York-based investment manager Ingalls & Snyder. ""Hybrid is a great alternative to a pure electric vehicle (and) it's an easier sell to a lot of customers.""
Interest in hybrids is rebounding as consumer demand for pure electrics has not accelerated as quickly as expected. Surveys cite a variety of reasons for tepid EV demand, from high initial cost and concerns about range to lengthy charging times and a shortage of public charging stations.
“With the tightening of emissions requirements, hybrids provide a cleaner fleet without requiring buyers to take the leap into pure electrics,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions.
S&P Global Mobility estimates hybrids will more than triple over the next five years, accounting for 24% of U.S. new vehicle sales in 2028. Sales of pure electrics will claim about 37%, leaving combustion vehicles — including so-called “mild” hybrids — with a nearly 40% share.
S&P estimates hybrids will account for just 7% of U.S. sales this year, and pure electrics 9%, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles taking more than 80%.
Historically, hybrids have accounted for less than 10% of total U.S. sales, with Toyota’s long-running Prius among the most popular models. The Japanese automaker has consistently said hybrids will play a key role in the company's long-range electrification plans as it slowly ramps up investment in pure EVs.
Ford is the latest to roll out more aggressive hybrid plans. On its second-quarter earnings call in late July, Chief Executive Jim Farley surprised analysts, saying Ford expects to quadruple its hybrid sales over the next five years after earlier promising an aggressive push into all-electric vehicles.
“This transition to EVs will be dynamic,” Farley told analysts. “We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out.”
Among Ford’s competitors, General Motors appears to have little interest in hybrids in the U.S., while Stellantis will follow Toyota and Ford’s hedge by offering U.S. buyers a choice of different powertrains, including hybrids, until sales of pure electric vehicles start to take off after mid-decade, according to forecaster GlobalData.
In a statement, GM said it ""continues to be committed to its all-electric future ... While we will have hybrid vehicles in our global fleet, our focus remains on transitioning our portfolio to electric by 2030.”
Stellantis said hybrids now account for 36% of Jeep Wrangler sales and 19% of Chrysler Pacifica sales. In addition to new pure electric models coming soon, ""we are very bullish on hybrids going forward,"" a spokesperson said.
This year, manufacturers are marketing more than 60 hybrids in the U.S. Toyota and its premium Lexus brand are selling at least 18 different hybrid models, enabling the Japanese automaker to maintain its stranglehold on the sector.
Hyundai and sister brand Kia offer seven hybrid models, with Ford and Lincoln six. Stellantis offers just three, and GM’s sole entry, due out later this year, is a hybrid version of the Chevrolet Corvette sports car.
But hybrids remain in short supply at many U.S. dealerships.
Andrew DiFeo, dealer principal at Hyundai of St. Augustine, south of Jacksonville, FL, doesn't see EV adoption hitting the levels the Biden administration wants until EV charging stations are as ubiquitous as gas stations.
""Hybrids are a great bridge to whatever the future holds,” said DiFeo, adding, “I've got zero in stock (and) I've got customers that want all of them.""

Tesla (finally) releases updated Model 3 for North  American...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-150-trucks-making-121100645.html,"Instead of enjoying the mellifluous tones of Lady Gaga or the bounce music of the Arctic Monkeys, some drivers of newer Ford F-150 pickups are hearing unexplained loud crashing sounds, the noise of shattering glass, or high-pitched static through the cockpit's speakers.
This phenomenon has prompted more than a hundred complaints to Ford, some by customers who say the noise was so distracting that they either had to pull over and stop driving, or if parked, didn’t feel it was safe to get on the road.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the automaker issued a technical service bulletin recently addressing the noise issue in Expedition SUVs and the F-150 pickups from the 2021-23 model years, and the 2022 F-150 Lightning electric trucks.
Ford says its related to the amplifier in the vehicles’ sound systems, which seems obvious.
Without detailing the actual cause, the company says that it has developed a software fix that customers can get at dealerships or through a downloadable update. The fix supposedly adjusts the amplifier to filter out the speaker noise.
“We are working swiftly to make sure this is resolved for our customers,” a spokesperson said.
The Journal reported that in online forums, F-150 owners have been hearing a “sonic boom” or “ear-piercing static.” Drivers, in some cases, were able to turn it off right away. Others say it lasted for 15 minutes or more, persisting even after the car was shut off.
Several drivers who have complained to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the noise was above 100 decibels, a level similar to that of a loud concert or a car horn, according to the American Academy of Audiology.
“The louder the sound is, the shorter the amount of time that it’s safe,” said Sarah Sydlowski, former president of the academy. At 100 decibels, only a few minutes of exposure is considered safe, she said, according to the Journal.
A  spokesperson from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the agency is aware of the issue.

LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Novelis is still buying some aluminium from Rusal under contracts agreed before Russia invaded Ukraine, but since the war started last year it has shunned new deals with the Russian firm, the U.S.-based company's Chief Executive Steve Fisher told Reuters.
Rusal's aluminium will again come under the spotlight as the industry meets next month for what is known in the industry as the mating season, when producers, consumers and traders agree deals to buy and sell aluminium for 2024.
Currently there are no sanctions on Russian metal, but many consumers will not buy aluminium produced by Rusal, which accounts for 6% of global mined production estimated at around 70 million metric tons this year.
Novelis buys much of its primary aluminium metal from Canada and it gets ""insignificant"" quantities from Rusal, Fisher said, declining to detail quantities or say when its existing contracts with the Russian producer would expire.
""We have historical contracts in place with Rusal that we are honouring. Since the conflict in Ukraine began we have not entered into any new contracts, but things could change in the future, it depends on the conflict,"" Fisher said.
Owned by India's Hindalco Industries since 2007, Novelis is the world's largest aluminium recycler and 61% of the metal it consumes for its products used by auto and beverage firms is recycled, reducing its emissions and that of its customers.
Recycled aluminium uses 95% less energy than primary aluminium on average. Canadian aluminium and Russian aluminium mostly use hydropower, which significantly reduces emissions.
Novelis' customers including Coco Cola, Ball Corporation, Crown Holdings, Tesla, Ford Motor Company and Boeing span across Asia, Europe, North America and South America.
""Companies understand the difference between the carbon footprint of recycled versus primary aluminium,"" Fisher said.
Of the 3.8 million metric tons of aluminium Novelis consumed in the year to March 2023, around 2.3 million tons was recycled.
Aluminium is important for the energy transition, partly because it is used to manufacture cars and trucks that are less heavy -- a process known as lightweighting -- to achieve better fuel efficiency.
""Beverage can sheets make up about 60% of our business. Beverage packaging can be infinitely recycled into the same product again and again,"" Fisher said.
Novelis has a target to cut its carbon emissions by 30% in 2026 from 2016 levels and is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050.

LOUIS, August 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gateway Bronco has introduced a groundbreaking next-generation Sport SUV, the LUXE-GT™.

Based on the classic Ford Bronco, its design includes an all-new modern chassis developed by an international team, driving performance that competes with the world’s elite sport SUVs and 10 patents pending or granted.

""Our development team was chartered to create the best vintage Ford Bronco on the planet and after four years and millions invested into research and development, we overshot that target,"" said Gateway Bronco CEO Seth Burgett. ""Instead, we landed on the world stage with a vintage Ford Bronco that performs with the best sports SUVs the world has to offer.
""For ‘Project Pegasus’, we remastered the vintage Ford Bronco by keeping the essence of the classic SUV but elevated to modern day standards using the latest technology and safety features. The Ford 5.0-liter engine and 10-speed automatic transmission provide reliable power. The designer interior is both functional and so meticulously crafted that we have 10 patents applied to protect the design. The vehicle delivers multiple world’s first achievements in a vintage Ford Bronco including anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, electronic traction control and all-time, all-wheel drive. The LUXEGT by Gateway Bronco targets road going performance. We consider it to be equivalent of the Porsche GT3 for sport SUVs. It is a fully remastered vintage Ford Bronco.""
Gateway Bronco has earned a reputation for being the highest quality builder in the vintage Bronco space over the past seven years. The company earned milestones such as being the world’s first manufacturer of the vintage Ford Bronco to be licensed by Ford Motor Company, and later breaking the world record for a Bronco sold at auction at $650,000.
Burgett dreamed of a remastered vintage Ford Bronco that would deliver a world class driving experience; this is the culmination of a journey that spanned the globe. He partnered with an international team that included OEM vehicle designer and low volume auto manufacturer Premcar, Ltd in Australia, a world-class racing and development driver from California, Billy Johnson, and an ISO 9000 manufacturing center in Michigan, RLE International. MSPR for the vehicle starts at $400,000 and the SUV delivers performance competitive with the world’s elite sport SUVs on par with those made popular by Range Rover, Mercedes and Porsche.
Built on an entirely new chassis, the remastered vintage Ford Bronco features:
Full-time All-Wheel Drive
Anti-Lock Brakes
Electronic Stability Control
Electronic Traction Control
Generation 3, Coyote 5.0 with 10-Speed Automatic
All Stainless Exhaust with Ceramic Coating
Bi-Modal Active Exhaust Tuned for the Bronco
Push Button Start
18-inch Sport Wheels with BF Goodrich K02 Tires
4-Point Family Roll Bar
Focal Studio Sound System
Carplay Screen with Bluetooth
Rear Backup Camera
Power Windows
Air Conditioning
All Weather Denim Designer Interior with Leather Accents
Genuine Birdseye Maple Wood Bed and Tailgate
Patent Pending Soft Close Doors
Patent Pending Soft Close Tailgate
Color Matched Custom Bimini Top
LED Lighting Package
Ombré Design by Katy paint scheme
Glasurit ""Piano"" Finish
One of One – ""Big Sur Love"" treatment.
""The idea for the new LUXE-GT was conceived during a camping trip in Glacier National Park of Montana, developed in the Skunk Works engineering facility outside Melbourne, Australia, and unveiled in Monterey, California,"" said Burgett. ""Working with our team in Hamel, Illinois, Premcar developed a prototype we field tested across the Australian Outback at 120 mph over all types of punishing conditions. Now the vehicle is ready to take on the world.""
While the vintage Bronco styling remains intact on the LUXE-GT, the nostalgic profile conceals the full story. The body is structurally reinforced and provides a lower center of gravity. The ladder frame is 70 percent stiffer than popular aftermarket replacement frames while delivering superior rigidity. This frame enables cutting edge crush zones front and rear. The LUXE-GT is painted with a Glasurit Piano Finish by BASF for a rich European-style gloss.
Under the skin, every aspect of the vehicle has a modern upgrade, with ten patents pending or granted. That level of performance is possible due to a completely new, modern chassis that is significantly stiffer than the original Bronco, teamed with an independent suspension, electronic stability control, and anti-lock brakes. Safety was a key design element all along and every element, from the fuel tank location to the ride height was considered.
The powertrain consists of the proven high-performance 5.0-liter Ford Coyote V8 with 10-speed automatic and full-time all-wheel-drive. In LUXE-GT fashion, it is capable of acceleration from 0-60 mph in just 5.3 seconds. Stopping distance is equally impressive, with 60 mph-0 in only 148 feet compared to 180+ feet for most vintage Broncos using a non-ABS braking system.
It is easy for LUXE-GT buyers to create a bespoke build that reflects their personal style with the recent launch of the 3D configurator and a dedicated design team assigned to each project. The display Bronco includes the new Ombré Design by Katy package called ""Big Sur Love"", a limited-edition build. The striking gradient stripes are available in several colors and patterns and can be paired with any upholstery and flooring concepts imaginable. This unique livery is patent protected to ensure exclusivity for Gateway Bronco clients.
""The designer handcrafted LUXE-GT has made its public debut during Monterey Car Week and we’ve already taken orders,"" said Burgett. ""This investment-grade vehicle was designed with the safety of family in mind and built for sport performance. With production limited to only 25 units per year, it will be an exclusive offering with 12 orders placed.""
The SUV was completed at Gateway Bronco’s 60,000 sq. ft. state of the art manufacturing center in Hamel, Illinois. The facility is vertically integrated from metal fabrication to paint and final assembly. The facility has a relentless focus on quality and going green in 2024 with full solar throughout the facility supporting the founder’s personal mission to improve the quality of life for others.
Those interested in a LUXE-GT can leverage Gateway Bronco’s Consumer-Centric Design™ process and online 3D Configurator. Gateway Bronco delivers vehicles from the low $200,000 to $800,000 range.

30 Countries That have the Most External Debt,25-Aug-23,... companies enter into interest rate swaps. This is exactly what Ford  Motor Company (NYSE:F) did to manage its debt even as its profits and  performance has...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-most-external-debt-145830228.html,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 30 countries that have the most external debt. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that have the most external debt.
While all countries are facing enormous pressure because of rising interest rates, the countries with the highest external debt are dealing with an even bigger crisis due to higher payments as a result of higher interest payments. Often, countries as well as corporations are judged incorrectly for dealing with debt, as the traditional view has been that debt = bad. However, the correct use of debt can easily allow for better use of investment, not to mention a higher rate of return as compared to interest payments. In fact, this is exactly why countries and corporations alike have been talked advantage of rock-bottom interest rates in recent year to snap up debt, and invest it in areas where the rate of return is higher than the cost of borrowing. This is also why many major companies, especially the profitable ones, can also be among the most indebted companies in the world.
30 Countries That have the Most External Debt

Of course, there is always a risk that companies bet on when they go for debt; namely, that interest rates won't rise suddenly and sharply. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened in 2022, when the Fed consistently hiked interest rates in a bid to control inflation. Because of this hike, many companies have been hard hit, mirroring the impact of the countries that have the most external debt. This is also why interest coverage ratio, which calculates how many times a company can pay off its interest based on its profit, and is generally calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense, is considered to be especially relevant for highly leveraged companies where net debt can be significantly high and can indicate a company's liquidity or lack there-of.
Higher interest, combined with the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against most global currencies, has even resulted in some nations defaulting on their debt. While the U.S. has the total highest external debt in the world, being the strongest economy in the world has the trust of most nations even if its debt continues to rise amid higher interest payments. However, the U.S. also nearly defaulted on its debt due to the debt ceiling impasse which was resolved in May 2023, but definitely worried the countries that own the most U.S. debt, with most nations investing in U.S. government securities precisely because of their stability and safety.
According to the IMF, monetary policy being tightened by nations resulted in higher interest rates for the first time in several decades in the most advanced countries in the world. However, the organization concluded by stating ""Overall, our analysis suggests that recent increases in real interest rates are likely to be temporary. When inflation is brought back under control, advanced economies’ central banks are likely to ease monetary policy and bring real interest rates back towards pre-pandemic levels. How close to those levels will depend on whether alternative scenarios involving persistently higher government debt and deficits, or financial fragmentation materialize. In large emerging markets, conservative projections of future demographic and productivity trends suggest a gradual convergence towards advanced economies’ real interest rates."", which will be great news for the countries with the highest external debt in the world.
That will also be great news for highly leveraged companies, which have struggled with interest expense payments in the last year amid interest rate hikes. Generally, companies involved in industries which require a high amount of infrastructure or capital investment tend to be highly leveraged, including the automotive sector. Additionally, growth companies whose valuation is based on future cashflows are also negatively impacted by debt as future cashflows are discounted at a higher interest rate to arrive at net present value of a company. One of the biggest car companies in the world in Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) saw its operating profit plunge by 25% in Q2 2023 based on yen volatility and rising interest rates in the U.S. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) mentioned this in the company's Q2 2023 earnings call stating ""First, let me provide a summary of the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2023. The result for the first half was operating income of ¥1,141.4 billion, the business environment is changing dramatically such as the rapid changes of foreign exchange rates, raising interest rate, soaring materials prices and more."" The company went on to state ""However, because of recent sudden interest rate changes that the suppliers are telling us that they are struggling. From the viewpoint of protecting the suppliers, this time, we decided to take measures. So we will continue to look at the market production status and the profitability of our suppliers in detail to take the necessary responses. So we are taking these responses, but the effects will have to be permeated to all suppliers because of the commercial practices.""
In order to protect themselves from the risks of rising interest rates, many highly leveraged companies enter into interest rate swaps. This is exactly what Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) did to manage its debt, even as its profits and performance has been impacted by higher interest rates. The company mentioned in its Q2 2023 earnings call stating ""Our rent-adjusted leverage ratio as defined by our US syndicated credit facility was 2.1 times at the end of June. Our strong balance sheet will continue to allow for meaningful and balanced capital deployment. Our quarterly floorplan interest of $15.6 million, was an increase of $9.7 million from the prior year, entirely due to higher vehicle inventory holdings. We effectively managed our floorplan interest expense by holding excess cash on our floorplan offset accounts, reducing the balance exposed to interest as well as to our portfolio of interest rate swaps, which saved us $4.7 million in interest expense versus the comparable prior year quarter."" The impact of higher interest rates on profits has been reflected in investor guidance as well, and here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:
“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”
Methodology
To determine the countries that have the most external debt, we checked their total external debt from CEIC. For the countries with the highest total external debt, we then used their latest population statistics to determine external debt per capita. We then assigned 70% to the first criterion and 30% to the other, since a country's total external debt is a more important indicator but not the only one. This is why the U.S., which has the highest external debt in the world by a long shot, doesn't come anywhere near first in our list.
30. Qatar
Total external debt (in $m): 194,500
Total external debt per capita (in $): 72,167
Qatar's banks have seen external debt build up over the past few years, and changing economic conditions globally amid tightening of fiscal monetary policies could impact Qatar's external funding stability.
29. New Zealand
Total external debt (in $m): 206,008
Total external debt per capita (in $): 40,204
Despite already owing significant external debts, New Zealand is expected to borrow $35 billion more than was initially expected and interest rates are continuing to rise in the country.
28. Cyprus
Total external debt (in $m): 179,352
Total external debt per capita (in $): 143,311
Cyprus being one of the countries that have the most external debt doesn't bode well for the country and according to IMF, higher rates of inflation and interest could put in doubt the nation's ability to pay back interest on time.
27. Hungary
Total external debt (in $m): 294,395
Total external debt per capita (in $): 30,402
Hungary's debt jumped from 54% of GDP in 2019 to over 80% of GDP in 2022, and high external debt combined with currency fluctuations could put Hungary in a precarious position.
26. China
Total external debt (in $m): 2,452,765
Total external debt per capita (in $): 1,737
Despite being the second-largest economy in the world, China's debt is really not that high especially considering its debt per capita. Most of China's debt is actually state-owned as state-controlled banks provide loans to state-owned companies.
25. Mauritius
Total external debt (in $m): 199,334
Total external debt per capita (in $): 157,885
While its total debt is not much, Mauritius has a really high external debt per capita even as debt-service payments put the biggest squeeze on poor countries in the 21st century, according to the World Bank.
24. Portugal
Total external debt (in $m): 440,826
Total external debt per capita (in $): 42,473
Portugal is home to one the heaviest debt burdens in Europe and in 2023, aimed to slash its debt ratio to lower that of Spain and France.
23. South Korea
Total external debt (in $m): 664,986
Total external debt per capita (in $): 12,880
South Korea is among the countries with the highest external debt and its increasing household debt is a real issue for the economy.
22. Greece
Total external debt (in $m): 584,879
Total external debt per capita (in $): 55,352
Greece's debt crisis has been well-known for over a decade which resulted in the longest recession ever suffered by an advanced mixed economy. However, improvements were seen in recent years and in 2022, the EU committed to not watching over Greece's budget after the latter fulfilled fiduciary responsibilities.
21. Denmark
Total external debt (in $m): 500,762
Total external debt per capita (in $): 84,831
In 2017, Denmark paid off all its foreign currency debts for the first time in the country's history. However, its current external debt is still significantly high and has a AAA rating from Moody's.
20. Finland
Total external debt (in $m): 609,009
Total external debt per capita (in $): 109,596
Finland has a really high external debt, but also a public debt that is breaching EU thresholds. EU threshold state that public debt should not exceed 60% of GDP and Finland's public debt has crossed 73%.
19. Austria
Total external debt (in $m): 713,740
Total external debt per capita (in $): 78,931
Austria and Finland were the biggest opponents of a European attempt to increase debt and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said ""No new fund"", stating that relying on the existing 2020 debt should be sufficient.
18. Sweden
Total external debt (in $m): 1,012,575
Total external debt per capita (in $): 96,556
While it's counted among the most developed countries in the world, Sweden had to engage in external borrowings to built its infrastructure, including railways and hydropower, which make up a significant portion of its total debt.
17. Norway
Total external debt (in $m): 754,101
Total external debt per capita (in $): 138,186
While Norway is among the countries which have the most external debt, it is still in a net asset position, which means that government assets outweigh total debt owed.
16. Australia
Total external debt (in $m): 1,851,277
Total external debt per capita (in $): 71,261
Australia's currency has been depreciating against the USD recently, further adding pressure to Australia's external debt commitments, and has played a part in triggering a minor external debt crisis.
15. Belgium
Total external debt (in $m): 1,410,889
Total external debt per capita (in $): 120,905
European countries dominate our list of nations with the most external debt in the world and Belgium is also among the countries with the highest debt to GDP ratios in the world.
14. Spain
Total external debt (in $m): 2,494,889
Total external debt per capita (in $): 52,397
Spain was recently asked by the European Commission to limit its public fiscal spending in 2024 in order to reach financial targets. Even then, Spain has been credited with helping Morocco get off the FATF's grey list and improve its ability to seek additional debt.
13. Italy
Total external debt (in $m): 2,726,013
Total external debt per capita (in $): 46,316
Italy's familiar debt issues resurfaced again recently and has impacted its negotiating power amid discussions with the EU.
12. Canada
Total external debt (in $m): 2,652,714
Total external debt per capita (in $): 68,141
Canada's household debt is now higher than its entire GDP and the highest of any nation in the G7, with the blame mainly assigned to higher home prices.
11. Hong Kong
Total external debt (in $m): 1,819,706
Total external debt per capita (in $): 247,711
You will see many financial hubs in our list as the presence of large financial institutions with significant leveraged positions is counted towards the country's total external debt and Hong Kong is no exception.
10. Japan
Total external debt (in $m): 4,543,036
Total external debt per capita (in $): 36,308
While Japanese investors sold off foreign debts in 2022 in record amounts amid interest rates hike, they have now resumed a foreign debt purchasing spree. Japan also tops the list of countries with the highest debt to GDP ratio.
9. Singapore
Total external debt (in $m): 1,851,236
Total external debt per capita (in $): 328,407
Singapore is considered to be the financial capital of Asia and with the presence of many major finance companies with large debt holdings, it is unsurprising that Singapore is among the world's highest external debt countries.
8. Switzerland
Total external debt (in $m): 2,297,161
Total external debt per capita (in $): 261,942
Switzerland allocated nearly 40 million CHF to support developing nations struggling massively under external debt constraints but has been accused of not doing enough to help out.
7. Germany
Total external debt (in $m): 6,460,684
Total external debt per capita (in $): 76,840
Most advanced Western economies are counted among the countries which have the most external debt and Germany is one of them, with the 4th highest total external debt overall.
6. United States
Total external debt (in $m): 24,544,393
Total external debt per capita (in $): 73,643
The U.S. has the highest total external debt of any country by far, almost at the same level of the next three largest total external debt holders combined. While the U.S. avoided a debt default after a compromise was reached between Democrats and Republicans, it still faces higher interest payments because of the current economic scenario.

Elon Musk admitted X 'might fail'—then the social network ...,21-Aug-23,Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know.  6h ... Yahoo Finance. Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and  reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-admitted-x-might-110941259.html,"It seems like Elon Musk's infinite faith in X—formerly known as Twitter—might finally be running dry. The owner of the company—who is also the CEO of Tesla, and founder of the Boring Company and SpaceX—admitted the platform ""may fail, as so many have predicted.""
Spectators have been watching to see if X will survive mass layoffs, advertisers leaving en masse, public scraps between Musk and former employees, and other major cost-saving efforts.
Musk, the richest man on earth, posted on X last week: ""There are no great 'social networks' right now.""
He continued: ""We may fail, as so many have predicted, but we will try our best to make there be at least one.""
Unfortunately for Musk—who as recently as last week lost a host of major advertisers after their content was promoted on a pro-Nazi page—his vow to build a ""great"" platform came just before another embarrassing mishap.
X, which now operates with around 20% of the staff it did prior to Musk's takeover, has suffered a number of service outages and glitches in recent months.
In February users found they were unable to tweet unless their posts had already been scheduled—with a message appearing for customers telling them they had gone over their tweet ""limit.""
This issue was apparently caused by a Twitter staffer who accidentally deleted data from an internal service meant to prevent spam, according to reports from the New York Times.
During this weekend's incident, however, the platform saw some of the site's most successful content temporarily become unavailable—including a famous selfie from the Oscars award show posted by comedian Ellen DeGeneres in 2014.
If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars pic.twitter.com/C9U5NOtGap
— Ellen DeGeneres (@EllenDeGeneres) March 3, 2014
In March of that year, the site acknowledged DeGeneres’s photo was the most reposted tweet of all time with more than 1 million shares. At the time of writing that figure has increased to more than 2 million.
However, the image—a selfie that includes stars such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, and more—temporarily vanished over the weekend.
X did not immediately respond when approached by Fortune for comment.
“History is being erased”
Reports began circulating on Friday that content from 2011 to 2014 wasn't loading correctly—including images and links.
Fans of South Korean boy band BTS said they felt ""important history was being erased right before [their] eyes"" after they feared images of the musical group had been lost.
And even the X chairman himself isn't immune to the disruption.
Reporters from Fortune noted that images posted by the chairman between 2012 and 2013 aren't loading correctly as of Monday morning, including one captioned ""SuperDraco rocket engine fired at full thrust w a printed Inconel chamber. Used for Dragon escape & landing.""
However, instead of an image of the rocket, merely a shortened link for the image appears. This is one of a number of tweets posted by Musk a decade ago that are no longer appearing on the platform correctly.
But BTS fans and Musk supporters may not need to fear the images are gone forever. A tweet from Tom Coates, who was one of the first users to point out the glitch on Saturday, claimed that ""Twitter has now removed all media posted before 2014.""
However, a community note—a content moderation tool that is powered by users on the platform—counters, ""Images before/around 2014 are still saved on Twitter/X's servers, however, the t.co links appear to be broken at the moment.
""The famous Ellen DeGeneres selfie from the 2014 Oscars is currently missing from her tweet. But the original file is still available on their servers.""
Usually, Musk addresses issues or new features on the site on his own platform. On the image glitch, however, he has remained silent.

A.I. Steers the Auto Industry Toward Revolutionary Lanes
Artificial intelligence (AI) is fast revolutionizing the world in ways we couldn't have ever imagined and this technology will only become more ubiquitous in the coming years and decades. One of the industries that is undergoing a profound transformation with the integration of AI technologies is the auto industry. Known for its drive toward innovation, the auto space is leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance safety, efficiency and the overall driving experience. The emergence of generative AI (Gen AI) is paving new avenues for advancements within the industry.
As indicated by Futuremarketinsights.com, AI in the automotive market is poised to surge with a projected CAGR of 55% from 2023 to 2033. With the current market share at $9.3 billion, this growth trajectory is expected to propel it beyond $744.39 billion by 2033. Auto biggies like General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda and Mercedes-Benz are embracing AI for enhanced customer service and lucrative digital innovations.
The Marriage of AI and Automotive Innovation
The auto industry has long been at the forefront of technological advancement, pushing the boundaries of innovation. From the inception of the assembly line to the evolution of electric vehicles, it has consistently deployed technology to redefine mobility. And now in a world that is increasingly defined by AI, the industry once again finds itself at the heart of innovation, poised to navigate fresh frontiers of transformative progress.
The incorporation of AI and the utilization of ChatGPT within the industry serve as a driving force for reimagining conventional processes.
Beginning with design and prototyping, Gen AI offers a paradigm shift in how vehicles are conceived and created by facilitating rapid design iterations based on vast existing datasets. Engineers can now virtually simulate aerodynamics and structural integrity, enabling design optimization before creating a physical prototype. Tools like ChatGPT automate tasks like technical documentation, freeing engineers for more innovative tasks.
The domain of autonomous driving greatly benefits from AI. Generative AI's prowess can replicate countless driving scenarios, providing an invaluable training dataset autonomous system. Beyond training, these algorithms can make real-time predictions about other road users' behaviors, enhancing safety and adaptability.As self-driving tech advances, ChatGPT boosts safety and interaction. AI analyzes sensor data for quick navigation, obstacle detection, and passenger communication.
The enhancements also extend to customer engagement and personalization. AI tailors the in-car experience, including Infotainment systems, driving modes and even voice-based virtual assistants, adapting over time to individual preferences and driving habits. If you want a touch of personal flair in your vehicle, AI aids in vehicle customization. AI-driven tools, especially ChatGPT, are facilitating customer engagement, offering personalized responses and streamlining after-sales support, thereby providing quick and accurate information for improved customer satisfaction.
The ripple effects of AI's advancements touch even the logistical backbone of the auto industry — the supply chain systems. AI algorithms analyze historical data and consider factors like demand, capacity and logistics. These generate efficient production plans, minimizing costs and waste and maintaining quality by real-time defect detection. The algorithms help ensure inventory management, efficiency and high product standards.
Auto Giants Fast Embracing AI
General Motors and Google Cloud have forged a deep collaboration to integrate conversational AI technology into millions of GM vehicles. GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant, launched in 2022, employs Google Cloud's AI algorithms, offering drivers responses to common queries, navigation support and routing assistance. The partnership's success in implementing Google Cloud's AI within GM's OnStar service has paved the way for forthcoming generative AI deployments.
In 2019, General Motors introduced its first vehicles with integrated Google technology. The integration has expanded since then, granting users easy access to Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play from their vehicle displays. This partnership also led to the integration of Google Cloud's Dialogflow conversational AI technology. Presently, GM's OnStar virtual assistant handles over a million monthly customer queries in the United States and Canada, accessible in most GM vehicles from model year 2015 and newer, and connected through OnStar.
Earlier this year, GM announced its exploration of ChatGPT's applications as part of its partnership with Microsoft. Building on their collaboration in 2021 to expedite autonomous vehicle commercialization, this U.S. legacy automaker and Microsoft are delving into ChatGPT's potential uses.
GM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
GM's crosstown rival Ford employs a chatbot within its FordPass app and has introduced Ford Lucy, a chatbot communicating through car infotainment systems for real-time assistance. Japan-based Toyota utilizes the Toyota Intelligent Chatbot to engage customers, while Mercedes-Benz employs Ask Mercedes for interactive support.
In March 2023, Ford announced the establishment of Latitude AI, a fully-owned subsidiary dedicated to advancing hands-free, eyes-off-the-road automated driving technology. Latitude augments Ford's expertise in machine learning, robotics, software, sensors, systems engineering and operations, strengthening its commitment to evolving automated driving technology.
In June this year, Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft joined forces to introduce in-car ChatGPT AI across more than 900,000 U.S. vehicles equipped with Mercedes' ""MBUX"" systems. The company pioneered a test program, enabling select luxury vehicle owners to operate infotainment systems using ChatGPT. Microsoft's tailored chatbot leverages cloud infrastructure to enhance voice capabilities, marking a leap in human-vehicle interaction. By saying ""Hey Mercedes,"" drivers can issue commands and also engage in interactive conversations, suggesting a future where cars act as personal assistants. Insights gained from the program will shape future AI integration plans, enhancing driving experiences worldwide.
Making a significant stride in the progression of autonomous driving, Toyota announced in June the deployment of Gen AI capabilities to refine its vehicle design and engineering aspects. Toyota Research Institute has introduced a generative AI approach, enabling vehicle designers to integrate sketches and engineering criteria and streamline the alignment of design and engineering considerations, thus reducing iterations. The generative AI, virtual and augmented reality boost has fostered creativity, performance optimization, safety enhancement, creativity and collaboration. Additionally, Toyota employs machine learning for insights, material choice, user experience and safety improvements.
TM's close peer Honda is incorporating AI into its vehicles to alert drivers about impending traffic dangers and assist in preventing accidents caused by human mistakes. HMC's AI-driven driver assistance system observes driver actions and health through monitoring cameras and sensors. The company aims to achieve zero fatalities by 2050 and is supported by this technology, prioritizing passenger safety beyond what drivers alone can ensure.
Wrapping Up
The automotive landscape is undergoing a revolutionary shift through the rapid integration of Gen AI. This technology is not only reshaping design and safety standards but also fostering personalized customer interactions and optimizing supply chains. From sleek models to elevated consumer experiences, the potential of ChatGPT is set to make the future of the automotive industry exciting.
As automakers harness the capabilities of machine learning and data analysis, they should seize the massive opportunity of AI in the auto industry, ushering in new realms of innovation and creating vehicles that cater to the evolving demands of consumers.

The economic potential of cities has led to increasing levels of rural to urban migration, which has presented the modern world with pressing challenges such as traffic jams, environmental degradation, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of basic facilities. However, if managed properly with innovation and improved productivity, urbanization can play a significant role in sustainable development.
Goal 11 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls on governments to take measures to make cities safe, resilient and sustainable. This involves reducing air pollution, dedicating 45-50% of the space in cities to public spaces and streets, providing convenient and sustainable modes of public transport, and ensuring basic services like clean water, sanitation, and waste management.
Several large corporations have been undertaking measures to enable green, or sustainable cities by adopting environment-friendly practices. While the automobile industry remains a heavy polluter, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was the first company in the industry to adopt sustainable measures 24 years ago. Apart from focus on fuel efficiency, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) manufactures its cars using eight sustainable fabrics. As a result, two of its vehicles, Focus and Escape are recyclable. On the other hand, paint fumes are also recycled into fuel in the company’s Michigan plant. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050, and is planning to base all manufacturing of vehicles on 100% renewable electricity by 2035.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made it a mission to reduce carbon emissions, not just for itself but also for its partners. Since 2015, the company’s emissions are down by 40% through efficient use of green technology and environment-friendly measures. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has called on firms in its global supply chain to completely decarbonize. Over 200 companies that supply materials to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have already committed to using clean power for their productions. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Clean Energy Program offers e-training to its partners that have committed to reducing carbon emissions.
Environmentalists have also urged communities to adopt sustainable modes of transportation to help address the problems of traffic congestion and air pollution. Biking produces ten times less emissions in a kilometer than traveling the same distance in a car. A research by the University of Oxford in 2021 highlighted that using a bicycle instead of car could reduce an individual’s carbon emissions per day by as much as 67%.
Bogota, in Colombia, reduced its carbon emissions by 40% in 10 years between 2000 and 2010 by promoting the use of public transport instead of cars, and encouraging the residents to bike to commute. Bogota's rapid-transit-bus program carries 1.5 million passengers every day and the government has converted several kilometers of road sections into bike lanes to promote cycling as a mode of transportation. Barcelona, in Spain, has established a low emission zone that bans high emission vehicles from entering, and is only open to pedestrians and bikers. Oregon's Portland city has seen a drop in per-capita car mileage by 4% due to an increase in use of bikes and electric vehicles. The city's 2015 Climate Action Plan targets to have 80% of its residents living in neighborhoods with biking and walking infrastructure by 2030.
The e-bikes market has been thriving for some years now, especially since the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. Improved technology and designs have bolstered sales which are expected to grow by over 6% till 2025. American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) recorded a revenue of $73.9 million between 2019 and 2021 in e-bike sales. Of this, more than 50% came from selling kids e-bikes, which signals an encouraging trend of bike-riding among the youth. In 2019, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) launched its first electric motorcycle, called LiveWire and also acquired StaCyc, a brand of kids bikes. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) aims to have zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Duke (DUK) Rolls Out North Carolina's EV Subscription Program,29-Aug-23,The company has unveiled this pilot program in collaboration with three  vehicle manufacturers namely General Motors Ford Motor Company and BMW of  North...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duke-duk-rolls-north-carolinas-135600693.html,"Duke Energy Corp. DUK recently rolled out an electric vehicle (EV) charging subscription program for its North Carolina customers to promote clean transportation at a cost-effective rate in this state. The company has unveiled this pilot program in collaboration with three vehicle manufacturers namely, General Motors, Ford Motor Company and BMW of North America.
Highlights of the Plan
Per Duke’s 12-month EV Complete Home Charging Plan, the company will provide its North Carolina residential customers with energy worth 800 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month to charge an EV at home. In return for this, DUK aims to charge a flat monthly rate of $19.99 in its Duke Energy Carolinas service area and $24.99 in its Duke Energy Progress service area.
Customers who own an EV can enroll in the program from the beginning of September and enjoy the benefits of the program from Nov 1, 2023 onward.
Such plans will assist the company in providing smart energy choices for its customers while ensuring grid stability.
DUK’s Take on Electric Vehicles
Electrification in the transportation sector has been on the radar of U.S. utilities as decarbonization remains a major target for the majority of industries across the board. To achieve this, utilities have been taking measures to provide customers with upgraded infrastructure for charging their EVs as well as incentives to promote the electrification of vehicles.
Duke Energy has more than 600 EVs in its fleet, including more than 220 on-road vehicles. To lower emissions from the transportation sector, the company aims at increasing its EV fleet rapidly over the next few years.
By 2030, DUK pledges to convert 100% of its nearly 4,000 light-duty vehicles to electric and 50% of its approximately 6,000 combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives as more of these options become available.
With the solid expansion expected in the U.S. EV market in the next few years, such initiatives by Duke Energy, including the latest rollout of the EV subscription program, should strengthen its footprint in this market.
Peer Moves
Apart from Duke Energy, utilities that have been expanding their footprint in the EV market are as follows:
Entergy Corporation’s ETR eTech program promotes the adoption of electric-powered alternatives to many applications that traditionally require fossil fuels. The program offers customers an incentive for purchasing EV charging infrastructure.
Entergy boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ETR’s 2023 earnings suggests a growth rate of 4.5% from the prior-year reported figure.
PG&E Corporation PCG has proposed to build California’s EV charging infrastructure. As part of PG&E’s 2030 targets, the company is preparing the grid to quickly and safely power at least three million EVs. In the second quarter of 2023, PCG initiated two pilot programs, Empower EV and Multifamily Business and Small Business EV Charger, both designed to improve access to EV charging infrastructure for customers in underserved communities.
The long-term earnings growth rate of PG&E Corp.is 2.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings calls for a growth rate of 10% from the prior-year reported figure.
CMS Energy Corporation’s CMS Consumers Energy subsidiary is accelerating Michigan's EV transformation, committing to powering an additional 200 new EV charging stations across the state, including 100 fast chargers by the end of 2023. This is part of Consumers Energy's commitment to powering 1 million EVs in the communities it serves by 2030.
CMS Energy’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 7.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMS’ 2023 earnings implies a growth rate of 7.6% from the prior-year reported figure.
Price Movement
In the past three months, Duke Energy shares have increased 2.2% against the industry’s 2.5% decline.

It’s been almost a year since Jim Cramer made solid bets on stocks investors should consider buying on the weakness. When the Mad Money Host made the recommendations, oil prices had declined from $124 a barrel to about $82. The slide resulted in many commodity stocks coming under pressure and pulling back from the highs of the time.
Following the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, oil prices skyrocketed above the $100 a barrel level amid supply constraints and rising demand.  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were some of the beneficiaries of the high commodity prices that made it possible for them to resume dividends and buybacks as free cash flows increased significantly.
“Oil’s down big, gasoline down big, and you can now buy all sorts of stocks that benefit from cheaper fuel, especially the travel and leisure plays,” Cramer said at the time.
Stocks were under immense pressure in August last year as the US Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive monetary policy tightening spree. At the time, the focus was to push inflation levels lower through the hiking of interest rates. Cramer criticized the Fed for the aggressive stance that he believed would drag down the markets.
On the other hand, the concern was that higher interest rates would tip the economy into recession as it was trying to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown. While it’s always recommended to sell industrial stocks during an economic slowdown, declining commodity prices such as oil, according to Cramer, provided an opportunity to purchase at highly discounted levels.
Cramer has always insisted on capitalizing and building positions whenever the market gets challenging. Some of his long-term themes have always been in the tech industry and energy sector, which he believes will always outperform regardless of what policymakers do.
While the focus has always been tech plays, the Mad Money host has also made a name for himself by calling for greater diversification into other sectors.
Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 Stocks
While it is essential to stick with the magnificent seven of - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), it’s become increasingly clear that other stocks have value. Getty Images Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:GETY)  is one of the stocks that the CNBC commentator touted as having a solid business with solid long term outlook after it went public again via a SPAC merger.
While most people have always shunned SPAC stocks Cramer touted Getty Images for its core business that revolves around providing high quality visual images backed with a massive library of content
“This is one of the rare SPACs story where the merger target is a quality business, its actually profitable,” Cramer said. The remarks came after the stock had registered a 149% gain in a single day. However, as days went on the stock struggled to maintain the upward momentum.
Additionally, Cramer has always seen winners in the consumer discretionary sector as well as the healthcare sector going by his recommendations. He also maintains a close eye on the financial sector with eyes on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC).
While there has always been skepticism about Cramer’s recommendations, Long Cramer ETF, which goes long Cramer’s recommendations, is up by about 16% year to date. The outperformance attests to CNBC’s commentator's ability to get it right on winners in the market.
Our Methodology
In August 2022 Jim Cramer during his Mad Money show on CNBC made some stock recommendations. In this article we decided to take a look at how those stock recommendations played out. We calculated returns of each stock Cramer recommended back then and compared those returns with S&P 500's returns during the same period.
Jim Cramer Recommended These Stocks
10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)
Stock Gain since August: -21%
 S&P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest automakers in the US that designs, develops, and delivers a range of Ford trucks, commercial cars, and vans. The company remains under pressure as it continues to face headwinds in its bid to launch electric vehicles.
While Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has underperformed when compared to Tesla, the CNBC commentator believes there is significant   value to unlock in the company.
“I think the market ingenuity an innovation here at Ford are undervalued. Undervalued vs Tesla and possibly against everything else in the market,” Cramer said.
The automaker has already moved the launch of its all-electric Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Explorer for the European market to the summer of 2024 from early in the year. The company has already reiterated that its EV ramp-up may take longer than anticipated.
As other companies focus on electric vehicles, Ford may bring to market more hybrid options driven by the success of its current gasoline-electric options.
The focus on pure electric cars might explain why the stock is down by about 21% over the past 12 months compared to a 9.4% gain for the S&P 500.
9. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)
Stock Gain since August: -20%
 S&P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that engages in film and episodic television content production and distribution. In addition to content production, it also runs some of the biggest theme parks in the world. It has turned out to be one of Cramer’s big mistakes as the stock has struggled over the past one year.
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has had to contend with revenue struggles everywhere apart from international parks over the past 12 months. In the most recent quarter, the company lost about 12 million streaming subscribers as it also took a hit on restructuring costs and missed revenue projections.
Since Cramer recommended the stock, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is down by about 20% underperforming the S&P 500 by wide margins.
8. Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM)
Stock Gain since August: -4.8%
S&P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is a company that engages in the provision of environmental solutions to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Its core business revolves around collecting and transporting waste and recyclable materials.
The recommendation came at a time when Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) had signed big contracts and rewarded investors with a big dividend boost. While the stock has been in consolidation in recent months, it is down by 4.8% from August of last year, underperforming the S&P 500, which is up by about 9.4%.
7. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) 
Stock Gain since August: -1%
 S&P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%
Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. It operates in the Aerospace segment, offering auxiliary power units and propulsion engines, among other things. The Honeywell Building technologies provide software applications for radar and surveillance systems.
Cramer recommended Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) as one of the stocks well poised to benefit from declining commodities prices, such as oil, that was expected to fuel activity in the aviation industry. Additionally, he remained confident about the stock following great earning results.
Nevertheless, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) has been extremely volatile, rallying by more than 28% from October lows only to give back a good chunk of the gains. It is currently down by about 1% from when Cramer recommended it.
6. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)
Stock Gain since August: 10.8%   S&P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%
Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is an infrastructure company that specializes in liquefied natural gas-related business. The company owns and operates one of the largest pipelines out of Texas. When Cramer recommended the stock in August of last year, it was up by more than 59% on benefiting from rising commodity prices.
Cramer insisting that the stock was pretty darn cheap was spot on as the stock did rally 15% afterward. Nevertheless, as the year came to a close, Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) did come under pressure giving back a significant chunk of the gains.
Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) has outperformed the S&P 500, which is up 9.4% over the past 12 months. Cheniere is up by about 10.8% over the past 12 months.

UAW files unfair labor practice charges against GM Stellantis,31-Aug-23,Ford Motor said it offered a 9% wage increase through 2027 much less than  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-says-files-unfair-labor-234837349.html,"(Reuters) — The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday it filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against General Motors and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, saying they have refused to bargain in good faith.
Both GM and Stellantis denied the unfair labor charges.
Ford Motor said it offered a 9% wage increase through 2027, much less than the 46% wage hike being sought by the union.
Both charges seen by Reuters say the automakers over the last six months refused to bargain in good faith over wages and benefits.
UAW President Shawn Fain said in online remarks that the sides are far apart.
""We're going to fight like hell to get our equitable share of justice for workers,"" he said. ""We can get there - but these companies better buckle down and they better get serious.""
Fain said the Detroit automakers want the ability to close U.S. auto plants and move them to low-wage countries, adding that threats by the automakers to close U.S. plants are ""economic terrorism.""
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain.
Ford said its ""generous offer"" would provide hourly employees with 15% guaranteed combined wage increases and lump sums, and improved benefits.
""Overall, this offer is significantly better than what we estimate workers earn at Tesla and foreign automakers operating in the U.S.,"" Ford said.
The union's demands include a 20% immediate wage increase, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, shorter work weeks and additional cost of living hikes.
The current four-year labor agreements covering 146,000 workers at the Detroit Three automakers expire on Sept. 14.
Fain said neither GM nor Stellantis have made counter offers.
Stellantis said it was shocked by the UAW claims ""that we have not bargained in good faith. This is a claim with no basis in fact."" Stellantis also said it was disappointed that Fain ""is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining.""
GM manufacturing chief Gerald Johnson said the company strongly refuted the unfair labor charge. ""We believe it has no merit and is an insult to the bargaining committees. We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the UAW and are making progress,"" Johnson said.
Last week, the UAW said about 97% of members voted in favor of authorizing a strike if agreement is not reached by Sept. 14.

The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, enhanced profit sharing, substantial increase in paid time off, and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments.
The UAW said Ford wants no cap on temporary workers and that those workers would not participate in profit sharing, would earn less than 60% of the top wage rate for permanent workers and receive inferior health-care benefits.
Ford said it would boost starting pay for temporary workers to $20 an hour, up 20%, and offer permanent employees $12,000 in cost-of-living adjustments over the contract.
Ford said only 2-3% of Ford’s hourly workforce are temporary employees, the lowest among the Detroit Three.
The UAW said Ford's profit-sharing formula change would have cut payouts by 21% over the last two years, while Ford said it was offering a $5,500 signing bonus upon the contract's ratification for permanent and temporary workers.

16 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today,31-Aug-23,One of these involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine  current performance and future prospects. ... Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s  biggest...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-best-high-volume-stocks-022353062.html,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 best high volume stocks to buy today. If you want to skip our introduction to different metrics of stock trading, then head on over to 5 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today.
One way in which technology has impacted the financial world is the ability to monitor trends in share movements. Investing in the market can be done through multiple approaches. One of these involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine current performance and future prospects. The other involves analyzing market trends and seeing which stocks are currently generating interest. Interest in a stock on the stock market can be either negative or positive, and some indicators that can be used to gauge investor sentiment are the relative strength index (RSI), short interest, and volume of shares traded.
The relative strength index is a mathematical computation that analyzes whether shares of a firm are overbought or oversold. It is also used to determine whether the share price is about to reverse a trend, with the chart's inability to either cross or meet previous highs or lows thought to be bearish or bullish indicators. For more details about oversold and overbought stocks, you can check out 10 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy.
The short interest in a stock is the number of shares that have been sold short on the market. Short selling, for the uninitiated, attempts to profit from negative share price movement by rooting out inconsistencies in management or the overall business model. Short sellers either buy options that enable them to sell shares at high prices or directly sell the stock on the market after borrowing it. To see which stocks are currently on the short seller radar and a detailed explanation of what short selling is, you might be interested in 16 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now.
Finally, a rather simple metric to see what's happening in the market right now is the volume of shares traded. Rather self explanatory in nature, this just takes a look at the shares that are changing hands right now. Unlike the previous two indicators, however, it can not help in gauging the sentiment behind these transactions. So, the volume of shares traded has to be combined with other indicators, such as the share price gain or loss and moving averages for several time periods to understand the underlying reasons behind market events. Additionally, the volume itself is often measured and compared by dividing the current volume with multiple month averages to truly determine whether anything unusual is happening around a stock.
This is because the singular reading of a stock's volume is based on its liquidity and shares floating on the market. These factors are often crucial determinants of returns and pricing as well since stocks with low liquidity (or low demand or supply of the shares) can often lead to 'flash crashes' as the price rapidly deteriorates. Finally, the volume of a stock is also influenced by its popularity as large and mega cap stocks often have more liquidity and greater volume while other, smaller firms can lag in this area. Of course, volume is not limited to stocks only, and instead, it measures sentiment surrounding any security that is being traded on a market, whether it's a stock, an exchange traded fund (ETF), or a currency. We recently took a look at 20 Biggest ETFs by Volume and found that the top three were ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (NASDAQ:SQQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).
But what about stocks? Well, some high volume stocks with good indicators are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and you can check out the rest below.

It can take 10 years to break even on fuel with EVs — here's a quick comparison of the key costs if you're on the fence
The United States is experiencing an electric vehicle (EV) boom. Drivers across the country bought nearly 300,000 new EVs in the second quarter of this year — an almost 50% jump from the same period last year, according to Cox Automotive.
A number of factors, including price cuts, tax credits and a wider variety of available EVs, may be boosting sales — but questions remain about whether it’s financially feasible for the average American driver to buy an EV.

Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds
Worried about the economy? Here are the best shock-proof assets for your portfolio. (They’re all outside of the stock market.)
Even after prices fell nearly 18% year over year in July, according to Kelley Blue Book (KBB), EVs still come at a premium when compared to their gas-powered relatives. The average EV price in July was $53,469 versus an average price of $48,334 across all vehicles.
Despite their higher purchase prices, EVs can be more cost-efficient in the long run. One way drivers can save big is on the price of charging up against gassing up. The Department of Energy has a calculator that allows you to compare the fuel economy between two different car models. For some EVs, it can take a decade of savings on fuel in order to make up for the higher upfront cost versus a comparable gas-powered model.
But fuel economy isn’t the only factor when it comes to the cost of owning a car. Drivers must also consider things such as the price of servicing, maintenance, insurance and even tax credits.
Here’s a peek at the fuel efficiency of some EVs compared to their gas-powered equivalents, plus we take a closer look at how some common vehicle costs compare between EVs and regular cars.
Fuel efficiency
One of the most popular vehicles in the U.S. is the Ford F-150 pick-up truck, which now has an electric model, the Lightning. The starting price of a 2023 Ford F-150, according to KBB, is $33,695, while the starting price of a [2023 Ford F-150 Lightning](https://www.kbb.com/ford/f150-lightning/2023/ is $49,995.
Based on the Department of Energy’s fuel economy calculator, assuming you drive 15,000 miles a year, the Ford F-150 Lightning could save $16,630 on fuel costs over 10 years compared its gas-powered equivalent — just about making up the $16,300 difference in the original purchase price over a decade.
Meanwhile, two of the most popular SUVs in the U.S. are the Toyota RAV4 and the Tesla Model Y. The starting price for a 2023 Toyota RAV4 is $27,575, according to KBB, while its all-electric competitor, the 2023 Tesla Model Y, starts at $47,490.
The calculator shows the Tesla Model Y could save $12,220 on fuel costs over 10 years, compared to the gas-powered Toyota RAV4 — meaning that it could take over 16 years to break even on the higher upfront cost of the EV.
It’s important to note that there are many variables at play here. The prices of cars and fuel may vary depending on the features you opt for and your location. The calculator’s settings allow you to adjust for actual purchase price and even the terms of your car loan. You can also tweak the number of miles driven each year, how often you drive in a city setting and even the cost of gas and electricity.
But there’s more to the cost of owning a car than the price of fuel, which we’ll dive into below.
Driving habits
As displayed above, it generally costs less per mile to charge an electric vehicle than to fill up a gas-powered car.
To calculate how much it costs to charge your EV, you need to know the total kilowatt-hours (kWh) it takes to recharge the battery and multiply that by the price you pay per kWh for electricity.
The national average price per kWh of electricity was $0.169 in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But remember that rates can vary depending on your utility company. Some areas also offer lower rates if power is used during non-peak hours.
Using the $0.169 per kWh average, if you have a 75 kWh battery in your car — the typical battery size in a 2023 Tesla Model Y — it would cost you around $12.68 to recharge the battery if it’s been fully depleted.
Meanwhile, the national average price of gas, as of Aug. 30, was $3.827 a gallon, according to AAA. The standard capacity of a gas tank is between 13 and 16 gallons, so you may have to pay anywhere from around $49.70 to $61.17 to fill your tank from empty.
But this comparison doesn’t tell the full story. How you drive may impact your vehicle’s fuel or energy consumption. For instance, aggressive driving, including rapid acceleration and hard braking, can dramatically decrease gas mileage, according to the Department of Energy. Actions that will increase the energy demand will also impact the range an EV can travel on a single charge.
According to a Bloomberg analysis of more than a decade of EV sales, the average EV sold in the U.S. has a range of around 300 miles between charges.
Finally, it also takes significantly longer to charge an EV than it does to fill up a gas tank. If you don’t have a charger at home, you may have to go out of your way to find a location to recharge your battery. So, if you live by the motto “time is money” then maybe an EV is not currently worth it for you.

Tax credits
EVs are increasingly accessible for Americans thanks to federal tax credits introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
In 2023, motorists are able to claim up to $7,500 in credits for purchasing an EV that meets certain conditions.
Some of the most popular EVs – the Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y, Chevrolet Bolt, Rivian R1T and Volkswagen ID.4 – qualify for at least some of the IRA tax credits. If that’s not incentive enough, you can also get a tax credit if you install an electric car charger at home. Under the IRA, you can claim a credit equal to 30% of the cost — up to a maximum benefit of $1,000.
Maintenance and repair costs
When you swap a traditional gas engine for an electric motor, you will typically see lower recurring maintenance costs because you don’t have to pay for things like oil changes or replacing timing belts and water pumps.
The life expectancy of EVs is also increasing as battery technology continues to improve, according to Robert Walden, founder of Vehicle Freak.
“While you might shell out more upfront, you're also investing in a longer-lived vehicle,” he told the Daily Mail.
The cost of repairing an EV, however, is another story. According to a 2021 report by CNET, citing data from analytics firm We Predict, repair-related costs averaged $306 for EVs and $189 for gas-powered vehicles. The discrepancy was attributed to EVs requiring additional labor hours to diagnose and fix problems due to the technology being relatively new to mechanics. Additional certifications required to service EVs may also be a factor. The price gap may decrease as more mechanics get certified and gain further experience servicing EVs.
Auto insurance
Insurance for EVs can also cost more than insurance for conventional gas-powered vehicles.
“An electric car's higher price tag and more complex equipment means it may cost more to repair or replace if it's in an accident,” according to Progressive. “That can mean higher rates for policyholders who carry comprehensive and collision coverage.”
“This additional risk has nothing to do with the driver — it's due to the technology in the car itself,” the insurer added, noting that EV insurance rates should go down as the cars become more commonplace and the availability of EV parts and qualified repair shops grows.
When it comes to car insurance, it can pay to shop around. If your policy is about to renew and the cost has jumped significantly, you should consider getting at least three quotes from other insurance companies just in case you can get a lower rate. Remember that it helps to have a clean driving record, with no at-fault accidents or moving violations.

Research and Markets Logo

The global plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) market has witnessed remarkable growth in the year 2021, surpassing total sales from 2020.
Plug-in hybrid vehicles, featuring both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, are powered by gasoline and batteries respectively. The ability to charge PHEV batteries through regenerative braking, wall outlets, or charging equipment provides flexibility to users. These vehicles can operate purely on electric motors until the battery is depleted, automatically switching to the internal combustion engine. The market growth is further propelled by various components such as the battery pack, charging port, electric generator, electric traction motor, and more.
Steady Expansion of the Electric Vehicle Market
The global electric vehicle market has showcased significant expansion in 2021. The PHEV market has notably increased its share and is projected to exhibit gradual growth in the upcoming years. Alongside plug-in hybrid electric passenger vehicles, a diverse range of light-duty plug-in hybrid electric vehicle models are currently available in the market.
Challenges Faced by the Vehicle Industry
The automotive industry experienced a sales decline in 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19, leading to weaker economic growth. Import restrictions from China impacted manufacturing plants and assembly lines worldwide, affecting vehicle production. The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) estimates a 13% decrease in global vehicle manufacturing in 2021 compared to 2019.
Growing Demand for PHEVs
The rising trend toward zero-emission vehicles, coupled with the need for short-range commutes of 40-60 km, has driven global demand for electric vehicles. Governments worldwide are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting low-carbon energy alternatives. Electric vehicle technology advancements have contributed to the growth of the electric vehicle market, with over 6.8 million units sold in 2021. Notably, China's PHEV sales doubled in 2021 compared to 2020, exceeding 600,000 units.
Preference for Short-Distance Travel Boosts PHEV Demand
Consumer preference for electric vehicle range has led to a push for longer ranges by automakers. New plug-in hybrid vehicle models in 2021 showcased an 8.5% increase in average driving range, exceeding 60 km. This enhanced range caters to daily short commute travel needs, further driving demand for PHEVs. China, Europe, and the United States capture the majority of the global electric vehicle market, while developing nations are also witnessing growth. Total global plug-in hybrid vehicle sales grew by over 90% in 2021 compared to the previous year, with a significant portion attributed to China.
Challenges in Initial Cost
Despite their benefits, plug-in hybrid vehicles come with a higher initial purchasing cost due to larger batteries and advanced components. While maintenance costs are lower than internal combustion engines, the higher upfront cost slows down adoption in some regions. Fuel savings and incentives can offset these costs, but the overall cost difference remains a factor affecting the pace of market growth.
Leading Industry Players
Prominent players in the global PHEV market include Renault SA, Nissan Motor Corporation Ltd., Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Company Ltd., General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Daimler AG, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., and Toyota Motor Corporation.

Here is What to Know Beyond Why Ford Motor Company (F) is ...,04-Sep-23,While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a  company's financial ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-ford-motor-130010209.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has lost 7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share, indicating a change of +33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.2%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.96 indicates a change of -7% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.21 billion and $158.31 billion estimates indicate +7.5% and -1.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $42.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.09 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.83%. The EPS surprise was +41.18%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Ford Motor's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
A look at the shareholders of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 58% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ford Motor.

ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Ford Motor does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ford Motor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Ford Motor is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.6% and 7.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Ford Motor Company. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$623m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.
General Public Ownership
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with Ford Motor (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

UAW makes contract counteroffer to Ford; Stellantis to make ...,06-Sep-23,... Ford Motor while Chrysler parent company Stellantis planned its  counteroffer this week. ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal  Finance · Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-plans-contract-counteroffer-ford-181418341.html,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) -The United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Wednesday made a labor contract counterproposal on economic issues to Ford Motor, while Chrysler parent company Stellantis planned its counteroffer this week.
Talks are heating up ahead of the expiration on Sept. 14 of the current four-year labor agreements covering 146,000 workers at the Detroit Three automakers. The UAW has said 97% of members voted in favor of authorizing a strike if agreement is not reached.
""They chose to follow the same path they have in the past, which is delay, delay,"" UAW President Shawn Fain told CNBC Wednesday night. ""They waited now until the last eight days to want to start talking -- so we've got a lot of work to do.""
Last week, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase through 2027, much less than the 46% wage hike being sought by the union. The UAW expects to receive a proposal from General Motors on Thursday, a source told Reuters, who spoke on condition of anonymity. GM confirmed it will meet with the UAW Thursday but declined to provide any details.
Stellantis said on Wednesday it intends to give the UAW a counter offer on the union's economic demands by the end of the week.
Ford said Wednesday it continues to negotiate with the UAW but declined comment on details of the talks.
Last week, the UAW filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, saying they refused to bargain in good faith.
The union's demands include a 20% immediate wage increase followed by four 5% annual wage hikes, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost of living hikes.
The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, enhanced profit sharing and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments.
The UAW said Ford wants no cap on temporary workers and that those workers would not participate in profit sharing, would earn less than 60% of the top wage rate for permanent workers and receive inferior health-care benefits.
Ford said it would boost starting pay for temporary workers to $20 an hour, up 20%, and offer permanent employees $12,000 in cost-of-living adjustments over the contract.
The UAW said Ford's profit-sharing formula change would have cut payouts by 21% over the last two years, while Ford said it was offering a $5,500 signing bonus upon the contract's ratification for permanent and temporary workers.

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-raises-pay-8-000-124119517.html,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said about 8,000 U.S. workers represented by the United Auto Workers union will get an average $4.33 an hour in additional pay under provisions of the current contract agreed in 2019.
Ford announced the pay increases as talks with the UAW for a new contract are headed for a Sept. 14 strike deadline.
The union has rejected Ford's recent wage increase proposals as inadequate. But Ford was the first among the Detroit Three automakers to put forward a detailed economic proposal in this contract round as it campaigns to set the labor pattern for the unionized U.S. automakers.
Under Ford's 2019 contract, permanent hourly manufacturing employees were eligible for a pay increase if they were hired prior to the 2019 contract effective date and were earning at least $24.40 per hour as of Sept. 1, 2023, the company said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Alteryx Inc, a data analytics software company with a market value of $2.5 billion, has been working with an investment bank to explore a potential sale after attracting takeover interest, according to people familiar with the matter.
Fierce competition from big rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Oracle Corp, as well as setbacks in winning new business, have suppressed Alteryx's valuation and made it an acquisition target. Its shares had lost almost half their value in the last 12 months prior to news of its exploring a sale.
The Irvine, California-based company is being advised by investment bank Qatalyst Partners on its discussions with potential acquirers, which include private equity firms, the sources said.
Insight Partners, an early investor in Alteryx which has retained a 1.5% stake in the company and representation on its board of directors, has recused itself from the sale deliberations because of its interest as a potential acquirer, one of the sources said.
Alteryx co-founder and Executive Chairman Dean Stoecker, who owns 11.5% of the company but controls it through dual-class shares that give him 51% of all outstanding shares' voting power, is considering the possibility of rolling his stake in any deal, that source added.
Expressions of interest that Alteryx has received thus far have not met its valuation expectations, and the company may decide against any transaction, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
Alteryx and Qatalyst did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Insight Partners declined to comment.
Alteryx shares ended trading on Wednesday up 14% on the news at $34.58.
Alteryx, which debuted in the stock market in 2017, counts more than 8,300 companies as its customers, including Coca-Cola Co, Vodafone Plc, Walmart Inc, and Ford Motor Company. Its platform allows businesses to quickly analyze and crunch data.
In recent years, Alteryx has transitioned to a subscription-focused business model as part of a strategy to tap into growing demand for data analytics services.
In its most recent quarter, Alteryx posted a net loss of $120 million due to higher sales and marketing expenses. The company has been revamping its sales operations, including with training and coaching, after losing its North America sales chief and recording slower growth in signing up new customers.

Tesla (finally) releases updated Model 3 for  North American...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/honda-joins-ford-gm-others-175441467.html,"Honda will join Ford, GM and other electric vehicle makers in adopting Tesla's charging technology, the company announced Thursday.
Honda Motor Co. said it will use Tesla's fast-charging port for its EV models that go on sale in North American starting in 2025.
Ford and General Motors announced similar deals with Elon Musk-owned Tesla in June, and electric truck maker Rivian followed suit later that month.
Analysts say that Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector and cord are much lighter and easier to handle than the Combined Charging System (CCS) used by the rest of the auto industry.
Tesla has about 17,000 Supercharger stations in the U.S. There are about 54,000 public charging stations in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy, but many charge much more slowly than the Tesla stations.
As more and more automakers switch to Tesla’s connector, experts say it appears Tesla is on its way to becoming the industrywide standard. That would mean more revenue and a huge competitive advantage for the company, which sells more EVs than anyone else in the U.S.
Chargers often are located near freeways to enable long trips, where most fast-charging plugs are needed.
The addition of yet another EV maker to its charging network could rankle Tesla owners, though the Austin, Texas-based company appears to be holding back at least part of its network for exclusive use by Tesla owners, analysts say.
Earlier this year, the White House announced that at least 7,500 chargers from Tesla’s Supercharger and Destination Charger network would be available to non-Tesla electric vehicles by the end of 2024. But the rollout thus far has been slow.","{'negative': 0.800531804561615, 'neutral': 0.7166110177834829, 'positive': 0.8799440562725067}",0.7166110177834829,0.8799440562725067,0.800531804561615

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-affordable-cars-buy-160829391.html,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 most affordable cars to buy in America in 2023. If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Affordable Cars To Buy In America In 2023.
Factors to Consider When Buying an Affordable Car 
When it comes to buying an affordable car, there are several factors that you should consider before making a decision. One of the most important factors is the condition of the vehicle. You want to ensure that the car you are buying is in good condition and will last you for many years.
Another essential factor to consider is the price of the vehicle. You want to ensure you get a good deal and not overpay for the car. In 2022, the average price of a new vehicle in the United States was approximately $48,681.
Fuel efficiency is another crucial factor to consider when buying an affordable car. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average fuel economy of vehicles sold in the United States in 2020 was 24.9 miles per gallon (MPG) for combined city/highway driving.  Finally, you should consider the safety features of the car. You want to ensure that the vehicle you choose has all the necessary safety features to keep you and your passengers safe while on the road.  The senior consumer advice editor and content strategist at Edmunds, Ronald Montoya, said: 
""Think about your actual needs, how long your commute is, how much you have to carry, and if you actually enjoy driving and might want something sporty. Avoid overbuying – you can probably get by with a smaller vehicle for most of your needs, and just rent something bigger once or twice a year, when you really need it.""
Electric and Hybrid Options on a Budget 
If you're in the market for a new car and want to consider electric or hybrid options on a budget, you're in luck! There are more options than ever before for eco-friendly vehicles that won't break the bank. One option is the Nissan Leaf. Another option is the Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)'s Prius C, known for its affordability and fuel efficiency.
The Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s C-Max Energi is another excellent option. the Ford Motor Corporation (NYSE:F)'s C-Max Energi has a plug-in hybrid system allowing electric-only driving for short distances. The CEO Jim Farley was optimistic about Ford's trajectory when it comes to the EV industry. He made the following comments in a company's capital market meeting in May, 2023:
""But clearly, this transition to EVs is dynamic and so much more than just a change in propulsion. The number of global entrants is increasing even at the high end and the pricing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 60 days. Despite these puts and takes, we have confidence in the underlying trajectory of Ford’s business. Our portfolio of businesses is strong, thanks to businesses like Pro and Blue, and we are raising our estimated EBIT guidance this year to $11 billion to $12 billion.
Operationally, we continue to be focused on capital discipline, solid returns even as we face uncertainties in the external environment. Supply chain disruptions are persistent, but they’re now easy. And we have more work to do to streamline our industrial system, reducing costs and improving quality. While EV adoption is still growing, the paradigm has shifted. EV price premiums over internal combustion vehicles fell more than $3,000 in the second quarter and nearly $5,000 in first half. We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out, and we are confident from a brand, from our incredible product strategy, our software, our scale and our cost position, we will be one of the winners long term.""
Remember to consider tax incentives and rebates that may be available for purchasing an eco-friendly vehicle. With so many options available, making a responsible and budget-friendly choice for your car is easier than ever. 
Dynamic Changes in Auto Industry Trends and Sales Projections for 2023
As we approach 2023, the auto industry is undergoing fascinating changes in sales trends. The surge in new car purchases can be attributed to the allure of cutting-edge technology and advanced features in the latest models. 
In October 2022, TrueCar forecasted a 15% growth in total new vehicle industry sales, reaching 1,165,658 units, similar to September when adjusted for selling days. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle industry sales is estimated at 14.6 million units, a 13% increase from October 2021. Excluding fleet sales, U.S. retail deliveries of new cars and light trucks are expected to be 995,808 units, up 9% from last year but down about 2% from September 2022.
However, the growing demand for cars and the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage are causing a decline in used vehicle inventories. Consequently, both used and new vehicle prices are expected to rise shortly. This shift in the marketplace adds excitement to the automotive industry landscape.

25 Most Biodiverse Countries in the World,10-Sep-23,For instance Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has adhered to a comprehensive  ten-point environmental policy over an extended period. The corporation  incorporates...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-biodiverse-countries-world-195307367.html,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most biodiverse countries in the world. To skip our analysis of global biodiversity, its ecological and economic impacts, as well as some companies that operate within this space, go ahead and see the 5 Most Biodiverse Countries in the World.
Biodiversity, or biological diversity, refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of species, genes, and ecosystems. It encompasses all living organisms, from the smallest microorganisms to the largest mammals, and the interactions they have with each other and their environments. The term biodiversity is often considered a measure of the health and resilience of ecosystems, and its loss can have far-reaching ecological, economic, and societal consequences. Although sustainability commitments are increasingly prevalent in corporate strategic planning, there remains a significant gap in attention to the critical investment required for the preservation and augmentation of global biodiversity.
As per the World Economic Forum (WEF), over 50% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) relies significantly or to a moderate extent on ecosystem services. These services encompass natural resources, groundwater, and the essential role of pollination in food production. However, biodiversity investment goes beyond sustainability; it also presents a compelling business proposition. In the coming decade, the WEF projects that safeguarding natural ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity could unlock business prospects valued at a staggering $10 trillion yearly while concurrently spawning approximately 400 million fresh employment opportunities. These opportunities span various sectors, including enhancing energy efficiency in construction and implementing circular economy solutions within the automotive, electronics, and textile industries.

Thus, declining ecosystems hold massive financial repercussions for companies. Similar to the asset-price bubble of 2008, this phenomenon eludes straightforward linear understanding. However, once set in motion, its consequences can far surpass the ordinary. Such a scenario holds substantial significance for businesses, affecting them in both the immediate and long-term contexts. As an illustration, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a body associated with the United Nations, has calculated that the economic worth of food production directly reliant on pollinating insects ranges from $235 billion to $577 billion on a global scale. Additionally, the UNDP states that degrading ecosystem could trigger a downward spiral of approximately $2.7 trillion in global GDP by 2030.
Businesses perceived as environmentally conscious often cultivate an image of responsibility, yielding advantages in both public perception and practicality that extend beyond their immediate operations. Nevertheless, prioritizing cost savings through reduced energy consumption takes precedence. In addition to curbing energy use, these forward-thinking organizations allocate resources to R&D, and actively champion social initiatives aimed at fostering eco-friendly products and internal procedures. For instance, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has adhered to a comprehensive ten-point environmental policy over an extended period. The corporation incorporates sustainable fabrics into its vehicles, with an impressive 80% recyclability rate for both the Focus and Escape models. Furthermore, Ford boasts ownership of one of the world's largest green roof. Aside from Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have several initiatives that are aimed at marking a positive impact on global biodiversity, either by reducing emissions and cutting back on toxic substances used in manufacturing products.

Transformational Opportunity for EV Customers and Electric Utilities
The development of this project comes at a time when electric vehicle sales and infrastructure growth are ramping up quickly, bringing new opportunities to address challenges for the electric grid. More EVs on the road means increased electricity demand on utilities to charge them. ChargeScape aims to provide energy management services to help support grid resiliency while looking ahead to the future of V2G capabilities that will benefit both EV customers and electric utilities.
Additionally, ChargeScape will play a role in helping to decarbonize the grid. The company's efforts will reduce EV customers' personal carbon footprints by utilizing electricity that comes from more readily available renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar. While seamless integration between EV customers and utilities will be key to energy management success, participating EV customers will always remain in control of their charging and energy decisions.
""Electric grid reliability and sustainability are the foundation for an EV powered future,"" said Thomas Ruemenapp, Vice President, Engineering, BMW of North America, LLC. ""ChargeScape aims to accelerate the expansion of smart charging and vehicle-to-everything solutions all over the country, while increasing customer benefits, supporting the stability of the grid and helping to maximize renewable energy usage. We're proud to be a founding member of ChargeScape and are looking forward to the opportunities this collaboration will create.""
""Electric vehicles are unlocking entirely new benefits for customers that can save them money while supporting grid resiliency and increase the use of clean, renewable energy,"" said Bill Crider, global head of charging and energy services, Ford Motor Company. ""ChargeScape will help accelerate the true potential of the EV revolution by providing significant benefits to both utilities and EV customers through smart vehicle-to-grid services.""
""As Honda seeks to achieve our global goal of carbon neutrality, we are counting on this platform to create new value for our customers by connecting EVs to electric utilities, strengthening grid resources and reducing CO2 emissions,"" said Jay Joseph, vice president of Sustainability & Business Development, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ""With automakers accelerating toward the electrified future, we must find solutions like ChargeScape that enable all stakeholders to work together for the good of our customers, society and our industry by enabling greater use of renewable energy for and from mobility.""
Benefits of Working Together
ChargeScape, along with the work done to date through OVGIP, will bring managed charging benefits to more EV customers and can eliminate marketing and outreach costs for utilities trying to reach their individual customer bases. BMW Group, Ford Motor Company and American Honda have direct, multi-channel communication with their EV customers, solving a central problem for utilities that typically do not know or have an easy and cost-effective way to identify the EV customers in their service territory.
Additionally, by leveraging automaker telematics, ChargeScape intends to provide managed charge scheduling through vehicle connectivity without requiring Wi-Fi-enabled charging stations. This will support the many EV customers who do not use ""smart"" chargers at home, as their EVs would otherwise be unreachable for grid services.
The three founding members welcome other automakers to join in and fully unlock opportunities provided by ChargeScape's grid service offerings once the company is fully operational.

New data on Friday painted a better picture for the Fed, with the University of Michigan's consumer survey showing that consumers' short-term inflation expectations had moved down to lows not seen in more than two years.

Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Is a ""Detroit 3"" Autoworkers Strike Imminent?
It’s just three days to go before the expiration of the contract between the Detroit Three automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — and the United Auto Workers (UAW). The current UAW contract expires this Thursday (on Sep 14) at 11:59 p.m. and no agreement has been reached yet. The clock is ticking fast and the threat of a potential strike looms large.
So, how do things stand now as the countdown draws near? What does the UAW want and are the demands overly aggressive? What do the counterproposals from the Detroit Three entail, and how is the UAW reacting to them? And how would the UAW strike, should it come to pass (the chances of which are quite high), affect the Detroit 3, the auto industry in general and the economy as a whole? And lastly, why should investors care? Let’s discuss.
Profits vs. Workers’ Pay: The UAW's Bold Stand
The UAW had been demanding a 40% pay raise for over four years, which eventually translates to a 46% hike owing to the compounding effect of the raises, according to Detroit automakers. This would have raised the wage of a top-scale assembly plant worker from the current $32 per hour to approximately $47. However, over the weekend, the UAW union moderated its stance on pay-increase demands, revising its request to a 36% raise, down from the initial 40%.
Apart from a 36% wage hike over the next four years, the UAW also calls for a reduced 32-hour workweek, the elimination of the tiered wage system, the restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, defined pension benefits for workers and the reestablishment of retiree medical benefits, among other requests.
Currently, UAW workers hired after 2007 lack defined-benefit pensions and receive reduced health benefits. The union has sacrificed pay raises and cost-of-living increases over the years to aid cost control. Top-scale assembly workers earn $32.32 per hour, while temporary workers start at just under $17.
Also, as Detroit automakers transition to electric vehicles (EVs), the UAW seeks union representation in EV battery plants. They argue that workers transitioning from engine and transmission manufacturing to EV production should receive their current top assembly-line wages, which currently stand at around $32 per hour, without any job losses due to technological shifts.
It should be noted that Shawn Fain, UAW president, admits that union's demands are ""audacious."" However, given the Big Three automakers' $21 billion profit in the first half of 2023 and $250 billion over the past decade, he contends that automakers can afford significant pay raises. Fain emphasized that these massive profits haven't translated to adequate pay or benefits for auto workers compared to executives and believes record profits should result in record contracts.
GM, F & STLA’s Proposals & UAW’s Response
As the first to submit an offer, Ford proposed a cumulative 10% pay increase over the four-year contract, along with lump-sum payments to counter inflation. It claimed this would boost average annual pay, including overtime and bonuses, from $78,000 last year to more than $92,000 in the first year of the contract. Additionally, Ford eliminated wage tiers and raised the starting pay for temporary workers to $20 per hour, a 20% increase.
GM's proposal included a 10% wage increase, supplemented by two 3% lump-sum payments. The offer entailed a $5,500 ratification bonus, a $6,000 inflation-recognition payment and $5,000 in inflation-protection bonuses over the contract's duration. In-progress employees could see a potential 56% increase over four years, and temporary workers were offered a 20% wage hike to approximately $20 per hour.
Stellantis, the last to present its proposal, offered UAW workers a 14.5% total wage increase during the contract, without lump sums. The company did include a one-time $6,000 ""inflation protection payment"" in the first year and $4,500 in inflation protection payments over the contract's final three years. While these cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) met a UAW request, the union insisted on COLA being integrated into contracts rather than as one-time payments. Part-time ""supplemental"" workers were promised a wage increase to a starting rate of $20 per hour, a 25% raise.
While all proposals included contract-ratification bonuses, none of them agreed upon the UAW's request for a reduced workweek.Fain expressed strong dissatisfaction with F and GM’s offers, labeling them ""insulting"" and far from equitable for American autoworkers. STLA’s offer too didn’t go down well with Fain, with the UAW publicly voicing its criticism of the proposal, citing concerns about the preservation of tiered compensation, insufficient wage increases, the absence of COLA, and the lack of an improved profit-sharing plan, among other issues.
The Looming Strike
Fain describes talks with the Detroit Three as slow but ongoing, emphasizing the union's desire to avoid a strike. He expressed readiness for round-the-clock negotiations, despite receiving no response for over a month. However, Fain remains committed to the needs of some odd 150,000 UAW-represented autoworkers, warning that he's prepared to call a historic strike if demands go unmet.
Although the UAW reduced its pay increase request from 40% to 36%, Detroit automakers remain unimpressed with the offer. The automakers still find the union's demands costly, citing their substantial upcoming expenses for combustion-engine and electric vehicle production, including battery and assembly plant construction. They argue that an overly generous UAW contract could raise vehicle retail prices, making Detroit automakers less competitive against European and Asian rivals.
As negotiations near their deadline, a substantial gap persists between the companies and the union. Many industry observers anticipate an imminent strike, with the UAW potentially opting to strike one, two or all three automakers.
Far-Reaching Consequences of the Strike
The UAW strike could not only reverberate through the Detroit 3 but also significantly impact the wider auto industry and even the U.S. economy as a whole.
Lest we forget, it isn’t the first time the UAW has flexed its muscles. The 2019 GM strike lasted 40 days and resulted in a staggering loss of $3.6 billion for the company. Such statistics underline the profound economic implications a strike can bring. Per estimates from the Anderson Economic Group, even a 10-day strike against all three automotive giants could result in losses nearing a billion dollars.
In broader terms, this equates to a potential hit of $5.6 billion to the U.S. GDP in just 10 days. This could plunge auto-reliant states, such as Michigan, into a recession, affecting countless livelihoods and destabilizing the region's economic fabric. Even a 10-day strike could take a huge economic toll.
The logistics and transportation sectors — which serve as the backbone of the auto supply chain — also stand at risk. Many firms in these sectors owe their continuous operations to the Detroit 3 and their suppliers. Consequently, a work stoppage at any of these auto behemoths could have dire consequences, potentially stalling businesses that hinge on the seamless flow of auto parts and vehicles. A UAW strike could bring significant portions of this industry to a standstill.
Recent events have already shown the vulnerabilities inherent in the logistics industry. The bankruptcy of Yellow Corp. in August resulted in job losses for 30,000 workers and highlighted the sector's susceptibility. If the UAW does move forward with the strike, it would add more strain to an already delicate situation, with long-term implications for stability and growth.
The strike may lead to an increase in vehicle prices, discouraging potential customers from making vehicle purchases due to the already high borrowing costs. A significant concern stems from the available vehicle supply. Sam Fiorani, an analyst at AutoForecast Solutions, stated that automakers had about 1.96 million vehicles available at the end of July, a sharp decline from the 4 million before the pandemic. If the strike extends beyond three weeks, the reduced supply could result in an escalation in vehicle prices and a potential shift in consumer preference toward non-union brands.
Parting Thoughts
As the expiration of the UAW contracts with the Detroit 3 automakers approaches, the industry stands at a crossroads. The repercussions of not reaching an accord would send ripple effects well beyond the automotive sector, emphasizing the pressing need for collaborative resolution. A balance needs to be struck, one where workers feel valued and companies remain profitable. This delicate equilibrium underscores the importance of collaboration and understanding between both parties. The outcome of the ongoing negotiations will determine the trajectory for many workers, businesses and even states in the coming months.
Amid potential labor unrest, what should investors do with stocks of GM, F and STLA? Notable analyst John Murphy has highlighted that F and GM stocks are currently priced for a strike. Legacy automakers like F, GM and STLA, having weathered numerous challenges over the years, remain fundamentally robust. For long-term investors, current stock prices, even with the looming threat of a strike, represent a promising entry point. Should a strike ensue and push these stocks lower, it might present an even more attractive buying opportunity. In essence, while short-term challenges lie ahead, the long-term prospects remain promising for the Detroit 3.

This week in Bidenomics: 3 things more important than ...,15-Sep-23,Yahoo Finance. This week in Bidenomics: 3 things more important ... Motor  Company Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne Mich. Friday Sept. 15...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-week-in-bidenomics-3-things-more-important-than-impeachment-190056245.html,"The Republican-controlled House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry into President Biden on Sept. 12. It might sound serious, but it’s meaningless and absurd. Impeachment is supposed to happen when there’s evidence of wrongdoing by the president. There’s no evidence of impeachable wrongdoing by Biden. The new Republican standard is to bring charges first and look for evidence later.
If the impeachment circus does turn up evidence that somehow went overlooked during five years of investigations into Biden’s interactions with his troubled son Hunter, then maybe it will be worth paying attention to. For now, however, it’s safe to disregard this pathetic stunt. If Hunter Biden ever runs for president, check back.
In the shadow of impeachment, meanwhile, three issues are developing that could loom over the Biden presidency for a while, and damage Biden if he doesn’t handle them adroitly:
1. The auto workers strike. There’s a good chance this could drag on, eventually pushing up car prices and hurting regional economies dependent on the auto sector. Biden, of course, has said repeatedly that he’s the “most pro-union president in American history,” so he has effectively picked a side — he’s with the striking workers. If he changes his tune, it would be an epic flip-flop.
Has Biden picked the winning side? That may be up to him. The strike is between unionized workers and their employers —General Motors, Ford, and Jeep-maker Stellantis — with no overt role for the federal government. But Biden has a huge stake in the outcome, and he has already dispatched senior aides to act as brokers for a deal.
The strike could last for weeks and cause real harm to both sides and in crucial swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin. The best outcome for Biden is an end to the strike in a month or less, with both sides kvetching a bit — that would indicate a relatively fair outcome. If the strike drags on, the more it will probably look like the United Auto Workers (UAW) — whose members already earn more than the typical assembly line worker — is simply being greedy.

The UAW suffered big setbacks when GM and Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009, and Ford almost did. Now, they want to claw back lost pay and prestige. Biden backed the striking workers in brief remarks on Sept. 15, the first day of the strike. But his green energy strategy — including millions of electric vehicles displacing gas-powered ones — relies heavily on strategic cooperation with domestic automakers. Biden needs to broker a deal before any real damage occurs, on either side. If that doesn’t happen, he could lose unions votes in 2024 or upset anti-union swing voters in swing states — or both.
2. Never-ending inflation. Prices crept back up in the latest inflation report, largely because of a bugaboo Biden can’t shake — energy costs. The annualized inflation rate in August was 3.7%, up from 3.2% in July. Global oil prices have risen more than $20 per barrel since the end of June, due mostly to production cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and Russia that have reduced supply. So raw energy prices — including gasoline — are higher, and prices of things that depend on energy, such as food, could rise, as well.

There’s still more than a year till the 2024 election, but the shock of inflation has clearly shaken consumer psyches and contributed to Biden’s weak approval rating. Biden probably needs several months of sustained low inflation for voters to really forget about inflation and focus more on the strong labor market and other things that are good about the Biden economy. Unfortunately for Biden, energy costs are likely to be a wild card he can’t do a lot to control.
3. The Hunter Biden indictment. This is separate from the impeachment farce, and it could break either way for President Biden, depending on whether there are any new revelations. As is, the case against Hunter Biden — one charge of lying on a handgun registration form, plus two possible charges of tax evasion — is small potatoes in a country wracked by vast amounts of tax cheating and thousands of firearm murders every year. Investigators have been probing Hunter Biden since the Trump administration, and there’s a good chance there’s nothing more to the story. Most importantly, there is no evidence, so far, of Joe Biden aiding, benefiting from, or even knowing about Hunter Biden’s misdeeds.

If it stays that way and Hunter Biden ends up convicted of smallish felonies, then nobody will be able to say the Bidens enjoy special treatment compared with former President Donald Trump, who’s currently facing 91 criminal charges in four different cases. If Hunter is, in fact, guilty, the best thing for his politician dad would be a quick trial that settles the matter well before Election Day and leaves voters to focus on Trump’s legal opus. If, on the other hand, new evidence does surface linking Biden to something illegal, then it could sink the elder Biden’s hopes of reelection. Before something else does.

Lengthy UAW strike could buy GM time to address nagging EV ...,17-Sep-23,DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors is at greater risk than rivals Ford  Motor ...

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors is at greater risk than rivals Ford Motor and Stellantis of disruption to electric vehicle production from a prolonged UAW strike - though some analysts say that could also buy it time to repair nagging issues.
While Ford and Stellantis are introducing several revamped combustion-engine models this fall, GM's immediate focus is on electric vehicles - with plans to launch or ramp up production of at least five new ones. They include all-electric companions to its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, according to researcher GlobalData.
GM has been struggling much of the year to smooth out hiccups in battery manufacturing as well as its EV supply chain and logistics, including delivery to dealers of its Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EVs.
The company delivered just 1,348 Lyriqs and 47 Hummers in the second quarter, far below expectations, in part because of issues with battery module assembly.
Chief Executive Mary Barra in July told analysts: ""Our automation equipment supplier is struggling with delivery issues,"" causing a bottleneck that had forced the automaker to assemble battery modules by hand.
In July, GM executive Rory Harvey said the company was working out delivery issues to dealers, noting that Lyriq and Hummer ""have been going down the line in very limited quantities (but) we are building momentum.""
A longer strike could help GM address and potentially resolve some of those ongoing issues in its EV and battery operations, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
""A production stoppage could allow GM to solve bottlenecks,” Fiorani said.
The automaker has not been able to roll out its most important EVs in a timely fashion, but could benefit if it used the labor stoppage to resolve some of its technical and operational issues, he said.
""GM could ramp up output faster once the factories start running again,"" said Fiorani.
'Potential nightmare'
Other analysts say the stoppage is unlikely to work out in GM's favor. GM's Barra herself said the strike ""would not be positive"" for the company and that it needed to reach a deal with workers quickly.
""For GM, a possible byproduct of an extended strike may be more time to work out any kinks they are having with their EV launches, but the potential loss of billions of dollars in the process would make it hard to justify such a 'silver lining,'"" said Bill Rinna, GlobalData’s director of Americas vehicle forecasts.
Wedbush auto analyst Daniel Ives said the strike was ""a potential nightmare situation"" for GM given it comes exactly at a key period of ironing out EV issues.
""In this crucial period of EV execution, model roll-outs, distribution, marketing, with EV competition rising across the board, the timing could not be worse,"" Ives said in a research note.
In addition, the UAW strike in the United States could affect the flow of critical auto parts to GM operations in Canada and Mexico, which would hamper EV production there, Rinna said.
GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico has begun building the Chevrolet Blazer EV and is adding production of the Chevrolet Equinox EV, while its Ingersoll plant in Canada is planning to produce the BrightDrop Zevo 400 electric delivery van, according to GlobalData.

The new agreement raises base hourly pay for production workers by almost 20% over three years, and by more than 25% for trade workers, the Canadian autoworker union Unifor said. It also gives permanent workers a $10,000 bonus and adds a cost-of-living adjustment, a mechanism that adjusts wages in line with inflation.
Ford described the pact as a 15% wage increase over the three year life of the agreement. But, according to the union, that figure doesn't include compounding of each annual increase or the initial cost-of-living increase, both of which should increase workers' actual pay.
Ford did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.

It's been one week since the United Auto Workers launched historic work stoppages against major car makers. The UAW’s targeted strikes against General Motors, Stellantis and Ford began after the union’s contract with the companies expired at midnight on Sept. 14. At the time, 13,000 workers walked out of three assembly plants.","{'negative': 0.941405326128006, 'neutral': 0.8325413266817728, 'positive': 0.8911081949869791}",0.8325413266817728,0.8911081949869791,0.941405326128006

And investors appear to be appreciating what that could mean for Tesla's profits.
Tesla stock is up over 7% since the beginning of September, outperforming a 4% rise in Ford (F) and a 1.3% gain for General Motors (GM). The relative outperformance of Tesla's stock versus the big two Detroit names has begun to widen since the UAW strike went into effect four days ago.
Tesla famously doesn't have a unionized workforce, the opposite of its legacy auto-making rivals who are now dealing with a potential catastrophe.
Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives thinks the legacy players will face years of mounting costs due to pressure from the UAW and as a result, weak profits.
""The big issue for GM and Ford as well as investors is around if anywhere near a ~40% wage increase gets approved/agreed this will be a major headwind on the cost front and ultimately in some way be passed down to the consumer and thru EV prices,"" Ives added. ""The costs of EV vehicles out of Detroit is a major advantage going after mass adoption with any $3k, $5k, $7k, etc. added to the slew of vehicles coming out would results in demand churn in our opinion.""
In other words, it would be fertile ground for Tesla to wrestle away market share with its entry-level Model 3 and other offerings.

With no end in sight to the UAW's calculated strikes at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis (STLA) amid a push for a 40% pay hike, Wall Street thinks the financial impact to all three is mounting.
Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli estimates a strike at GM's Wentzville assembly plant through September will zap operating profits this year by $140 million. The analyst sees a similar financial impact on the striking Ford assembly plant in Michigan.
The costs for each could surge if the UAW — under the leadership of vocal auto critic Shawn Fain — widens its strike to more plants. Doing so runs the risk of stunting sales while fixed costs remain bloated, a powerful combination that could aggressively eat through the cash positions of Detroit's Big Three.
""No one wins in a strike, particularly if it's prolonged,"" former Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You never make up the wages that you lost. You never make up the customers that you may have lost. And the impact could be devastating.""

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/experts-warn-dire-supply-chain-171659312.html,"Logistics and supply chain experts are sounding the horn warning that the ripple effects of the targeted United Auto Workers strike manufacturing strikes against the Detroit Three will hit the trucking industry hard and could leave the smaller tier 2 and 3 suppliers filing for bankruptcy.
“For every [General Motors] job, there’s six others in the economy that depend on us running, so we’ve got to get back to work,” Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, told CNBC.

Logistics and supply chain experts are warning that an extended United Auto Workers strike could have major impacts on the trucking industry. (Jim Allen/FreightWaves)
Some of those jobs in the automotive manufacturing ecosystem are in the trucking industry.
“The U.S. auto industry is a significant contributor to the nation’s freight economy,” stressed Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations. “Trucks move more than $950 billion worth of cars, trucks and parts. That’s hundreds of millions of tons of freight that are subject to disruption if this dispute continues for a significant period of time.”
Data from FourKites shows that between Aug. 20 and Sept. 14 there was a substantial uptick in rescheduled over-the-road auto shipments originating in Mexico and bound for the United States.
Tom Gregorchik, vice president of industry strategy at FourKites, told FreightWaves that the rescheduling is a result of auto firms beginning to hedge their bets that the strike threat was very real and would cause them to cancel or push out inbound parts from Mexico.
“Approximately 8% of all OTR auto shipments from Mexico to the U.S. have been rescheduled,” Gregorchik explained. “This is compared to the average 5% rate of shipments.”
Gregorchik said the average length of transit for OTR auto shipments from Mexico to the U.S. is now nearly double.
“In 2022, travel time was around 35 days,” he said. “OEMs are willing to accept longer transit times to reduce transit costs but for parts that they are willing to take the inventory risk on, they still have the components on the way should the strike be resolved quickly.”
Gregorchik said that based on the current state of negotiations, he predicts volumes from Mexico will continue to fall, adding that there’s more certainty components from Mexico will be needed to get production going again. This will hit the bottom line of the trucking industry and impact suppliers.
According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are approximately 5,600 U.S. suppliers and more than 690,000 supplier jobs tied to the Detroit Three — GM (NYSE: GM), Ford (NYSE: F) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA). These tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers account for anywhere between 20% and 70% of their business. The smaller suppliers, which are already facing challenges with increased costs and lower profits, may need to seek bankruptcy protection if the strike lasts several weeks.
The American Automotive Policy Council estimates that within the Detroit Three, each automaker assembly plant job supports nearly seven other jobs with suppliers, or about 871,000 workers.
“A prolonged strike could be a nuclear event for tier 2 and lower-level tier supply chain providers,” said Joseph McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions. “The combination of high interest rates and lack of PPP money will decimate suppliers that usually don’t have three months of cash on hand.”
The trickle-down impact of the decrease in parts moving out of the plants will not only impact the trucking industry but also dealership supply chains across the country.
Tom Maoli, owner of dealership chain Celebrity Motor Cars, told FreightWaves that his company is still recovering from the chip shortage as well as the delay in parts related to the Canada port strike.
“We can withstand a strike for two weeks,” Maoli said. “While we have a 45-day supply of cars, the big problem is auto parts. Past the two-week mark, we will have auto parts shortages.”
The automotive group has six dealerships that sell Ford, Chrysler, Lexus, BMW, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus vehicles.
“Even some of the foreign cars are exposed to this strike because some UAW plants make parts for the foreign cars,” Maoli said.
“If this strike continues and the supply of auto parts is impacted, it can impact the consumer transportation system,” he added. “If people can’t get their cars repaired and they have no other modes of transportation, they can’t go to work. The impact of this strike is far reaching and will impact the consumer.”

SEOUL (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Co and a union representing its South Korean workforce on Monday sealed a wage deal that will boost annual pay by about 12%, avoiding a strike and production losses at the company's biggest manufacturing base.
The union, one of the biggest in South Korea with more than 44,000 members, said on Monday that a total of 58.8% of its voting members had approved the tentative agreement reached last week, while 41.1% rejected it.
Unionised workers voted last month for a possible strike over demands for higher wages, a performance bonus and an increase in the mandatory retirement age to 64 from 60.
The union demand to increase the retirement age - which would have allowed workers to stay in their jobs, reducing reliance on the pension system, for longer - was not accepted.
Workers at Hyundai Motor, the No.3 global automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp, last went on strike in 2018.
Unionised workers at Hyundai in South Korea held a four-hour strike for one day in July in support of a general strike, but it was not related to the union's wage negotiations with the management.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) last week went on strike against all three Detroit automakers - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Stellantis - at once for the first time.
Hyundai Motor Group, which houses Hyundai Motor, Kia, luxury brand Genesis, operates U.S. production sites in Alabama and Georgia. The auto group currently is building electric vehicle and battery plant in Georgia.
“The labour risks have been there all along, especially in the auto sector, but this UAW strike is unprecedented. If the UAW manages to win major pay raises, it could make workers at foreign automakers, like Hyundai Motor and Kia, that operate non-union plants in the United States, think about the UAW representation,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq made a slight recovery on Friday as Treasury yields retreated from multi-year highs, while shares of Ford jumped on news of progress in labor talks with workers' union.
Ford Motor advanced 2.5% after Reuters reported the United Auto Workers (UAW) was set to announce progress in labor contract talks with the carmaker.
Consumer discretionary, which houses the automaker, added 0.4%.
U.S. Treasury yields pulled back after surging to fresh highs on Thursday, driving a rebound in some growth stocks including Apple, Amazon.com, Nvidia and Tesla, up between 0.2% and 2.7%.
Worries over another interest rate hike in 2023 and prospects of a delay in the easing of monetary policy had knocked down the three main indexes by more than 1% on Thursday.
Despite the slight recovery, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were on track for their worst week since March after the U.S. central bank delivered a hawkish pause on Wednesday, dampening hopes for policy easing before 2025.
""I don't think that the markets have fully thought through the economic impact of higher rates,"" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
""Higher rates mean higher cost of borrowing for everybody and should affect the marginal decisions to spend or grow businesses or employ people which should have a negative impact on the economy.""
Traders' bets on the benchmark rate remaining unchanged in November and December stood at 73% and 58%, respectively, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Data on Friday revealed U.S. business activity showed little change in September, with the vast services sector essentially idling at the slowest pace since February.
Several Fed policymakers, including policy voting member Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, are set to speak during the day.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vinfasts-second-quarter-deliveries-jump-112944558.html,"(Reuters) -Vietnamese electric-vehicle maker VinFast said on Monday it had delivered 9,535 vehicles in the second quarter, recording a more than fivefold jump from the first quarter.
The company, whose U.S.-listed shares fell 1.2% on Monday, reported 11,315 deliveries for the first half of this year.
VinFast's blockbuster debut on Wall Street in August saw its shares more than triple in value, but the company's small amount of publicly available shares has made the stock prone to volatility.
Its market capitalization, which was $160 billion - more than General Motors , Ford Motor and Volkswagen combined - in the weeks following its merger with a blank-check firm, fell to $40.4 billion on Monday.
VinFast was valued at $23 billion after special purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition agreed to acquire the firm for $10 per share.
The company is almost entirely controlled by Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest man and founder of its parent conglomerate Vingroup, with a stake of about 99.7%, according to a filing.
The EV maker plans to expand in seven more markets in Asia, including Indonesia, where it aims to start deliveries from next year and establish a plant by 2026.
The Indonesian facility will be VinFast's third after its main one in the northern Vietnamese city of Haiphong and a new plant in North Carolina in the United States, which is slated to start in 2025.
VinFast said it will report its second-quarter results on Sept. 21.

SALESKY: It’s still early days for this industry. No one’s actually scaled anything yet. None of these businesses work unless [they are] able to assemble a team to build a technology. We know how to do that. And [they have to] assemble the capital to see through the various phases of development and actually get to scale. We have that with SoftBank. So, we’re pretty excited about our chances.
TRUCK TECH: Stack is a word that gets tossed around a lot in autonomous efforts. How did you settle on that as a name?
SALESKY: Naming is difficult in any industry, right? But, we came up with a name that I think has both a literal and figurative idea behind it. So, you could imagine moving stacks of material, but you could also imagine that there’s obviously a pretty sizable tech stack that has to be built.
TRUCK TECH: You mentioned your work at the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University in the 2000s was pretty far-reaching.
SALESKY: No one was really talking about self-driving back then. But they would talk about the three D’s — dull, dirty, dangerous — as the good first applications for robotics. I led the software engineering for the Cat (Caterpillar) Autonomous Mining program. These vehicles are larger than your house. They are all now into production using the system that we created.
TRUCK TECH: And that translates to heavy-duty trucking?
SALESKY: [We] have learned over the years how to handle and how to build autonomy systems for heavy machinery. And we’ll be able to take that knowledge and bake it into what we’re doing at Stack.
TRUCK TECH: Your announcement was light on details of Stack AV. Any hints?
SALESKY: We’re focused on Class 8 trucks, and there’s a lot of white space even in that category. We’re looking at the business models. There’s really attractive economics throughout that vertical. We’re not getting into the specifics of exactly what we’re going to be automating just yet.
TRUCK TECH: SoftBank is reportedly putting $1 billion or more into Stack. What is their motivation?
SALESKY: AI is a strategic priority for SoftBank. They’re committed to investing in companies across a wide range of applications because they believe in the benefits that AI has to society and solving societal issues. When SoftBank invests, they typically invest big because they understand these are complex, capital-intensive businesses. So for us, the backing of SoftBank, I think, is signal enough that this is both a priority for them as well as something that they intend to see through.
TRUCK TECH: Other autonomous trucking developers have partnered with manufacturers to create redundant chassis. Will Stack?
SALESKY: There is a lot of redundancy that needs to be built into these trucks. Many of the vehicles in production today don’t necessarily have all of the equipment that you need. That creates the question of how do you accomplish that? We’re formulating our view on that. We’re certainly looking at a number of options, and partnering would be one of them.

Hyliion gets its Hypertruck ERX powertrain certification
Hyliion Holdings hit a critical milestone to being able to sell its Hypertruck ERX natural gas-powered electric powertrain with the approval of the California Air Resources Board. (CARB).
Actually, Hyliion and engine provider Cummins Inc. received a Dual Executive Order certifying the Hyliion powertrain meets California environmental requirements when paired with the Cummins’ ISX12N natural gas engine.
This is a big deal because it qualifies Hyliion to count in the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets mandates in the state that will phase out new diesel-powered trucks by 2035. The first 30 Hypertruck ERX systems will be sold in California, where they qualify for a 75% credit under the ACT rule and 100% under ACF.
Approval has a ‘limited shelf life’
However, the win has limits. Cummins is retiring its 9-liter and 12-liter engines in favor of a new 10-liter engine. Hyliion already was planning to move the ERX to Cummins’ 15-liter natural gas engine, which goes into production next year.
“CARB is not going to extend the 12-liter certification into 2024,” Hyliion CEO Thomas Healy told me. “This has a limited shelf life, but it tees up the certification of the 15-liter as well. Once you go through one, it’s a lot of duplicative carryover into the next. It shows CARB is approving of this solution and so when the 15-liter does come, we’ll get that certification as well.”
Until then, Hyliion can ship to 47 other states. It is bypassing Hawaii and Alaska.
Hyliion’s product progression moves to its Karno generator technology acquired from General Electric, but that has more development ahead and is initially planned for stationary power applications. A prototype hydrogen fuel cell truck with Hyzon Motors is in track testing. It is similar to other hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks. Healy’s skepticism of hydrogen adoption remains.
“The next step here is to figure out ‘Do fleets really want it?’” he said. “That’s something we’ve got to go through with Hyzon now that the truck’s done. Hydrogen adoption is going to be very specialized.”

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A senior Republican in Congress asked Tesla Tuesday to detail its relationship with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL amid concerns U.S. electric vehicle subsidies were improperly flowing to foreign entities.
The chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Jason Smith, asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a letter if the electric vehicle (EV) maker has contracts with CATL or is considering contracts.
Smith said the committee is concerned CATL ""may be trying to negotiate other agreements like the agreement with Ford."" Reuters previously reported Tesla was CATL's biggest client.
Republicans in Congress have been probing Ford Motor's planned $3.5 billion investment to build a battery plant in Michigan using technology from CATL, the world's largest battery maker.
The auto industry is watching how new rules around future EV tax credits will be implemented as they make investment decisions on producing batteries for their transition to EVs.
In 2022, Congress passed the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which will bar future EV tax credits if any battery components are manufactured or assembled by a ""foreign entity of concern.""
The foreign entity of concern rules are aimed at weaning the United States from Chinese supply chains and come into effect in 2024 for completed batteries and 2025 for critical minerals used to produce them. The question is what precisely constitutes a ""foreign entity of concern"", and so far no foreign battery supplier has been labeled as such.
Smith asked Musk whether, aside from boosting North American manufacturing, his company had ""taken any actions to increase production of the number of vehicles that will qualify for the clean vehicle credit?""
Smith also wrote Nissan on Tuesday asking for details about its battery suppliers and whether its U.S. manufacturing plans ""include the production of batteries or battery components for EVs?""
Tesla, CATL and Nissan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In July, Smith and Mike Gallagher, Republican chair of the Select Committee on China, demanded Ford answer questions about the CATL deal.
""We are concerned that the deal could simply facilitate the partial onshoring of PRC-controlled battery technology, raw materials, and employees while collecting tax credits and flowing funds back to CATL through the licensing agreement,"" the letter to Ford said.
Ford told Reuters Tuesday it agrees that ""U.S. taxpayer dollars should support American manufacturers, not foreign entities of concern."" It defended its planned battery plant as ""one owned and controlled solely by Ford, a proud American company.""
Ford is awaiting guidance from the U.S. Treasury to ensure the partnership does not run afoul of the Act.
Smith wrote Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Tuesday saying she should immediately issue the guidance and ""make clear in the most comprehensive way possible that taxpayer subsidies cannot flow to foreign entities of concern through any structuring mechanism conceivable.""
Treasury said the IRA is ""encouraging investments in America and building secure supply chains rather than outsourcing to places like China"" and it ""will continue to assess and respond to any national security concerns associated with both international and domestic supply chains.""

Tesla (finally) releases updated Model 3 for  North...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-ford-motor-company-nyse-120041413.html,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$15.35 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$11.75. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ford Motor's current trading price of US$12.39 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
Is Ford Motor Still Cheap?
The stock is currently trading at US$12.39 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 22% compared to my intrinsic value of $10.15. This means that the opportunity to buy Ford Motor at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
What does the future of Ford Motor look like?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ford Motor's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 79%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in F’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe F should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on F for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for F, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

More money pledged from Michigan for a $3.5 billion electric ...,25-Sep-23,DETROIT (AP) — More money is being pledged in Michigan for the development  of a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant after Ford Motor Co. said  it...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-pausing-construction-michigan-battery-211530218.html,"DETROIT (AP) — More money is being pledged in Michigan for the development of a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant after Ford Motor Co. said it would pause construction until it's sure it can run the factory competitively.
Ford announced the delay Monday and is in the midst of national contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, which wants to represent workers at battery factories and win them top wages.
On Tuesday, a Michigan economic development board voted to send an additional $65 million to the megasite that will be used for “assistance for site readiness activities,” according to a board memo.
“We fully expect that Ford will continue to develop the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan site and we need to allow the Ford Motor Company and UAW to continue their negotiations,” Quentin Messier, president of Michigan Economic Development Corp., said during Tuesday’s meeting.
The UAW went on strike against Ford and the other two Detroit automakers, General Motors and Stellantis, on Sept. 15. The union at first targeted one vehicle assembly plant from each automaker, and last week expanded it to parts warehouses. But Ford was spared from the expansion because the union said progress was being made in negotiations.
In February, Ford announced plans to build the plant in Marshall, Michigan, employing about 2,500 workers to make lower-cost batteries for a variety of new and existing vehicles. Marshall is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Detroit and is near two major interstate highways.
But Ford spokesman TR Reid confirmed Monday that plant construction has been paused and spending has been limited.
“We haven't made any final decision about the planned investment there,"" he said.
UAW President Shawn Fain called Ford's move “a shameful, barely-veiled threat by Ford to cut jobs"" at a plant that's not open yet.
""We are simply asking for a just transition to electric vehicles, and Ford is instead doubling down on their race to the bottom” with lower wages, he said.
The factory was to start making batteries in 2026, cranking out enough battery cells to supply 400,000 vehicles per year, Ford said.
It would produce batteries with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is cheaper than the current nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry now used in many EV batteries. Consumers could then choose between a battery with lower range and cost, or pay more for higher range and power.
While the state had allocated nearly $1.7 billion in incentives for the project, not all of the money has been sent out and there are clawbacks in place, said Republican State Rep. Sarah Lightner, who is the minority vice chair of the House Appropriations committee.
“Obviously, the strikes could probably have something to do with it,” Lightner said.
Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Guidehouse Insights, said Ford’s decision might be related to the strike, but more likely reflects opposition to the plant among people in a conservative rural area of southern Michigan.
""They don’t want the factory, they don’t want the traffic, and they don’t want anything associated with a Chinese company,” he said.
Earlier this year Virginia dropped out of the race for the same Ford plant after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin characterized the project as a “front” for the Chinese Communist Party that would raise national security concerns. At the time Virginia had not offered an incentive package to Ford.

Biden met with UAW picketers at GM's Van Buren Township parts distribution center in Michigan. ""Wall Street didn’t build this country, the middle class built this country. The unions built the middle class,"" Biden said to UAW workers on strike. ""Let’s keep going, you deserve what you’ve earned. And you’ve earned a hell of a lot more than you’re getting paid now.""
UAW president Shawn Fain joined Biden at the picket line as well, thanking the president for joining the strike, but stopped short of endorsing Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

The White House says Biden’s visit was the first time a sitting president has visited a picket line in modern times. The move comes as his Republican rival, former President Trump, indicated he would be visiting the state as well. On Wednesday, Trump is expected to hold a rally with 500 former or current union members in Clinton Township, Mich.
The Big Three — Ford, GM, and Stellantis — put out statements ahead of Biden’s visit, though they did not criticize the president for joining the UAW strikes.
“On the first day of the strike, President Biden said UAW workers ‘deserve a contract that sustains them and the middle class.’ We agree and presented a record offer,” Stellantis (STLA) said on its UAW negotiations website.

GM (GM) also stated that its “focus is not on politics but continues to be on bargaining in good faith” with the UAW to reach an agreement.
Ford also issued the statement on the president’s visit, which notably is where the company’s big Michigan Assembly Plant is located. “Ford and the UAW are going to be the ones to solve this by finding creative solutions to tough issues together at the bargaining table. We have a shared interest in the long-term viability of the domestic auto industry, the industrial Midwest and good-paying manufacturing jobs in the US,” the company said.
Ford also made waves on Monday when the automaker announced that it is pausing development on its $3.5 billion battery plant in Marshall, Mich., claiming the automaker had concerns about “competitively” operating the plant.

Ford declined to say what specifically changed in its planning, but the company stated it has not made a final decision on the planned investment at the site. Note that Ford is partnering with China’s CATL to license CATL’s LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery tech for new EVs. Ford had said in the past that it would own the battery plant, and would employ all the workers, but it is possible guidance on battery credits Ford would receive from the government changed due to Ford’s licensing agreement with CATL, leading to the pause in development.
Nonetheless, the UAW pounced on Ford’s decision, claiming it was a move to punish the union and union jobs, because of the UAW’s ongoing demands for higher wages.
“This is a shameful, barely veiled threat by Ford to cut jobs,” UAW's Fain said in a statement. “Now they want to threaten us with closing plants that aren’t even open yet. We are simply asking for a just transition to electric vehicles and Ford is instead doubling down on their race to the bottom.”

What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered Calls,29-Sep-23,Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company  (NYSE:KO) McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Ford Motor Company  (NYSE:F). In...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covered-call-10-best-stocks-150825324.html,"In this article, we discuss what is a covered call and 10 best stocks to buy or covered calls. You can skip our detailed analysis of the covered call strategy and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks for Covered Calls. 
What is a Covered Call Strategy?
A covered call strategy is an options trading strategy where an investor holds a long position in a specific stock or other underlying asset and simultaneously sells a call option on that same asset. The objective of this strategy is to generate income from the premiums received from selling the call option while potentially benefiting from the stock's price appreciation up to a certain point.
The covered call strategy has gained attention because it has historically provided appealing returns when considering the level of risk involved. The CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM), a benchmark index designed to track the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy, is often said to offer similar average returns as the S&P 500 Index but with about two-thirds less volatility, according to a paper published by CFA Institute. The index has delivered an 8.29% return to shareholders since the start of the year and its 12-month return came in at 11.78%, as of September 22. The report also mentioned that the covered call strategy has gained attention among investors over the years. In the 10 years that ended June 2014, the assets managed using these strategies have grown by over 25% each year.
Another Goldman Sachs study from January 2012 looked at 16 years of covered call trading (from 1996 to 2011) and found that using covered call strategies improved returns and reduced risk in diversified portfolios. The advantage amounted to a 3.6% annual increase in returns and a 20% decrease in the variability of monthly returns. This improvement was based on selling covered calls that were 10% out-of-the-money and had a one-month duration on S&P 500 stocks with readily tradable options. In addition to this, the study discovered that writing call options on large-cap companies was more effective than on small-cap companies. However, it didn't find a significant difference in results between value and growth stocks.
The popularity of this investment approach is evident in the success of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), the largest covered call exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, with assets totaling $26.8 billion. It has not only attracted the most new investments of any actively managed ETF this year but has also become the largest actively managed ETF overall. According to VettaFi’s data, $9.7 billion has been invested in JEPI ETF this year so far. One of the main reasons for this huge inflow is that JEPI is structured to hold a ""defensive"" portfolio of stocks, further minimizing risk.
Given the current market situation with continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation, analysts advise investors to add defensive stocks to their portfolios and sell call options on these defensive securities. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, spoke about the strategy in his interview with the Financial Times. Here are some comments from the analyst:
“Covered call strategies really started to gain traction with investors last year when there was more downside in the market . . . they were a way for investors to get above average income without taking on undue risk.”
For a covered call strategy, investors should consider established, large-cap, and blue-chip stocks that have a history of stability and are less likely to experience extreme price fluctuations. Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). In this article, we will discuss some other best stocks for covered calls.

In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

The US auto industry is currently in the spotlight amid a massive United Auto Workers’ strike against three major companies, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.  Analysts are now certain that these strikes will have direct effects on financial results of these companies in the coming months. Wall Street Journal recently reported that Wells Fargo analysts believe that the three companies’ proposals to increase auto workers’ salaries would “add an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.” Estimates suggest that these costs will reach $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion under the union’s demand of 30% increase in wages, plus cost-of-living adjustments.
However, the WSJ report quoted Richard Hilgert, a senior equity analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar’s research arm, who said that despite the strikes the auto companies are still in a position to escape massive losses given these strikes don’t prolong.
Analysts are also hinting that these strikes could expand to other parts of the industry, including the electric vehicle companies. Many auto components and parts companies that are directly or indirectly linked with traditional car companies and EV companies are anxiously waiting for these strikes to end. And they also have other plans in case the strikes do not end soon. The Wall Street Journal report quoted Ricardo Rodriguez, chief financial officer at Aspen Aerogels. Aspen Aerogels makes battery safety products for electric cars. Rodriguez said that if strikes in the auto industry expand to the EV sector or do not end soon, his company is ready to shift its focus to energy industrial products. The executive said his company could make the shift “within an hour.” Other companies are not that fortunate, though. Companies that supply parts and technologies to major car companies like Ford and General Motors are heavily reliant on the normal business cycle and these current disruptions could take a toll on their business. For example, according to the WSJ report,  Sensata Technologies, which makes sensors for cars, could see huge impact from the current strikes as Ford, GM and Stellantis account for a major chunk of the company’s revenue. The report, citing the company’s Vice President of Finance Jacob Sayer, said that about 9% of Sensata’s global revenue could be impacted if all plants for the three carmakers are offline.

Tesla: Exploring the New Risk Alert,29-Sep-23,In the fast-paced automotive industry Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a  pioneer in electric vehicles. Although the company's stock has seen a  significant...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-exploring-risk-alert-163013204.html,"In the fast-paced automotive industry, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a pioneer in electric vehicles. Although the company's stock has seen a significant recovery in 2023, it has not been immune to recent downward risks and financial turbulence. Tesla's commitment to spearheading advancements in EVs, autonomous driving and other futuristic technologies underscores its leadership.
However, several analyst downgrades have cast a shadow of concern and a trimming of price targets, with Deutsche Bank reducing its target from $300 to $285. These adjustments underscore the potential downside risks that the electric car manufacturer is currently facing despite the bank's long-term bullish stance.
Challenges and anticipations

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with TSLA. Click here to check it out.
TSLA 30-Year Financial Data
The intrinsic value of TSLA
The ever-changing financial climate introduces an additional layer of intricacy and challenges. High interest rates pose the threat of dampening consumer expenditure, which could potentially hinder the progress and adoption of EVs. There are also doubts regarding Tesla's ability to sustain its remarkable growth and manage the costs of raw materials for battery production.
Despite these challenges, Tesla's upcoming electric pick-up truck and a new affordable model platform for 2025 remain highly anticipated, promising to bolster its market position and fortify investor trust.
Even with immediate concerns, a reduction in analyst expectations and visible downward risks, Tesla's long-term strategy and vision stand resilient. The company's robust net cash position significantly mitigates the vulnerability to the rising debt issues facing other automakers, highlighting its financial stability in an unstable economic environment.
Concerns for Tesla's 2024 earnings

On Sept. 27, a note from Deutsche Bank raised concerns about Tesla's earnings for 2024. Despite maintaining a ""long-term bullish"" stance on the stock, analysts foresee a ""meaningful downside risk"" for the Wall Street consensus, given the possibility of restricted volume growth next year. Consequently, the bank lowered its price target from $300 to $285 a share.
However, Deutsche Bank remains optimistic about Tesla's position as a leader in the EV market, emphasizing potential competitive cost advantages over General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) in the future.
A lot hinges on Tesla's progress with a next-generation platform for a more affordable model planned for 2025. If the timeline is met, analysts believe investors will overlook the projected soft 2024, viewing it as a transition year. Despite warning about possible third-quarter delivery and production shortfalls, Deutsche Bank maintains its belief in Tesla's continued leadership in electrification for years to come, backed by its next-gen platform.
Adjustments in delivery and production

Deutsche Bank also flagged the downside risks to expectations for 2024 on both growth and earnings front. Tesla's plans of not expanding output at its Austin, Texas and Berlin factories to 10,000 vehicles per week and the anticipation of a ""positive halo effect"" from a new electric pick-up truck in Texas in the fourth quarter signify key adjustments in delivery and production outlooks.
The bank now expects Tesla to announce guidance of approximately 2.1 million deliveries for next year, in contrast to the Wall Street consensus estimate of 2.3 million units.
Analysts' diverse views

Tesla's stock dipped 6.8% in September amidst the downgrades and estimate cuts. However, Battle Road Research analyst Ben Rose upgraded the stock, focusing on the long-term outlook and its sustained market leadership in EV manufacturing. Despite production downtime leading to a cut in delivery numbers by Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner, Rose emphasized Tesla's continuous market share dominance, the potential of full self-driving software and growth in energy storage sales.
Overvaluation concerns

Tesla's financial footprint casts a significant shadow on the vehicles and parts industry. It boasts a cash-to-debt ratio of 3.97, outpacing 79.51% of competitors, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.11, surpassing 82.65% of industry peers. These strong financial positions showcase Tesla's relative stability and sound financial health, elements crucial for driving continued growth and navigating economic upheavals.
Additionally, with a three-year revenue growth rate per share of 36.4%, the company outpaces 93.78% of other companies in the space, underlining its sustained and robust revenue generation capabilities. Further, Tesla's three-year Ebitda and free cash flow growth rates stand at 83.9 and 81.4, respectively. These figures place the company ahead of more than 97% and 94% of competitors in the industry, highlighting its proficient operational performance and cash-generating potential.
Further optimism brews with Tesla's anticipated future three to five-year earnings per share without NRI growth rate at 26% and total revenue growth rate at 23.77%, outshining 84.31% and 92.5% of industry peers.
Despitethe positive outlook, Tesla's overvaluation remains a cause for concern. The company's price-earnings ratio, at 71.76, ranks lower than 90.68% of its industry peers, and its forward price-earnings ratio of 55.88 stands even lower, besting only 1.73% of competitors. Despite Tesla's solid performance metrics, this evident overvaluation emphasizes a downward risk, urging potential investors to tread with care.
Final takeaway

While immediate challenges and delivery adjustments pose concerns, Tesla's long-term outlook remains promising for many analysts. The consensus about the company's continued leadership in the EV market, alongside its advancements in next-gen platforms and other technological facets, underscores the optimism despite near-term hurdles.

US lawmakers demand documents on Ford battery ...,27-Sep-23,US lawmakers demand documents on Ford battery partnership with CATL. Ford  Motor to build $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan. By  David...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-lawmakers-demand-documents-ford-100441486.html,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairs of three U.S. House of Representatives committees demanded Ford Motor turn over documents tied to its partnership with Chinese battery company CATL and threatened to call CEO Jim Farley to testify before Congress.
Republicans Jason Smith, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Mike Gallagher - who chair the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and China select committees - jointly wrote to Farley with a new deadline seeking documents about the CATL partnership and the automaker's plan to build a $3.5 billion battery manufacturing plant in Michigan using Chinese technology.
""Ford’s ongoing refusal to provide substantive responses ... raises serious concerns regarding its licensing agreement with CATL,"" the lawmakers wrote on Tuesday in a previously unreported letter seen by Reuters.
Republicans have been probing Ford's battery plant plan for months over concerns it could facilitate the flow of U.S. tax subsidies to China and leave Ford dependent on Chinese technology.
On Monday, Ford said it paused work on the Michigan battery plant, citing concerns about its ability to operate it competitively as it remains in broader contract negotiations, drawing condemnation from the United Auto Workers union.
The lawmakers want documents including the Ford/CATL licensing agreement, communications between Ford and the Biden Administration referring to the licensing agreement and achievable tax credits, and records of Ford's knowledge of CATL's ""apparent attempt to shield its connection to Xinjiang-based companies.""
Human rights groups accuse Beijing of abuses against Xinjiang’s Uyghur inhabitants, including the mass use of forced labor in internment camps. China denies the allegations.
CATL did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The lawmakers said if Ford does not disclose records sought previously by Oct. 6 ""we will consider other means to obtain the documents, including compulsory process or insisting that you appear before Congress to publicly explain your failure to comply.""
A Ford spokeswoman said the company had answered multiple congressional letters and ""thoroughly responded to questions and shared detailed information about Ford’s work to strengthen domestic battery manufacturing"" but did not say if the company would comply with the document request.
In 2022, Congress passed legislation barring $7,500 in future consumer EV tax credits if any battery components are manufactured or assembled by a ""foreign entity of concern.""
Ford has been awaiting guidance to determine if batteries produced by the Marshall plant would run afoul of the requirements.
Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also faced questions from Smith about the automaker's relationship with CATL.

The automaker notched quarterly sales of 500,504 vehicles, up from 464,674 a year earlier.
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford joins other automakers in reporting higher sales in the United States, bolstered by the purchase of more new vehicles by consumers for personal mobility.
American buyers have also been swayed by attractive financing options and trade-in deals on new vehicles, which have advanced safety technology and better fuel efficiency ratings.
However, analysts eye a bumpy road ahead for the Detroit Three automakers due to the ongoing coordinated strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union against the companies that has sparked concerns over supply disruptions in the current quarter.
Overall, U.S. new vehicle sales in September were 1.33 million units, with an annual sales rate of 15.67 million units, according to data released by Wards Intelligence on Tuesday.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said in documents posted Monday on its website that it upgraded the investigation to an engineering analysis, a step closer to a recall.
The investigation now covers Ford's F-150 pickup truck, as well as Explorer, Bronco and Edge SUVs and Lincoln Nautilus and Aviator SUVs. All are from the 2021 and 2022 model years and are equipped with 2.7-liter or 3.0-liter V6 turbocharged engines.
The agency says that under normal driving conditions the engines can lose power due to catastrophic engine failure related to allegedly faulty valves.
The agency opened its initial investigation in May of last year after getting three letters from owners. Initially the probe was looking at failure of the 2.7-liter engine on Broncos.
Since then, Ford reported 861 customer complaints, warranty claims and engine replacements including the other models. No crashes or injuries were reported.
The company told the agency in documents that defective intake valves generally fail early in a vehicle's life, and most of the failures have already happened. The company told NHTSA said it made a valve design change in October of 2021.
Ford said in a statement Monday that it’s working with NHTSA to support the investigation.
The agency says it will evaluate how often the problem happens and review the effectiveness of Ford's manufacturing improvements designed to address the problem.","{'negative': 0.8302212119102478, 'neutral': 0.76817520459493, 'positive': 0.6606251895427704}",0.76817520459493,0.6606251895427704,0.8302212119102478

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto  · Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-tm-signs-supply-agreement-165700627.html,"Toyota Motor Corporation TM and LG Energy Solution have signed a battery supply agreement. This agreement will help Toyota acquire lithium-ion battery modules from LG to power its battery electric vehicles (BEVs) planned to be assembled in the United States.

LG will supply Toyota with 20 GWh of battery modules annually, starting from 2025. The supply will be sufficient for the production of 250,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per year.

Per the agreement, the battery modules will consist of high-nickel NCMA (nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum) pouch-type cells.

LG plans to invest $3 billion in its Holland, MI, plant to set up exclusive battery production lines for Toyota. The line will increase battery module supply to Toyota’s Kentucky plant. In the plant, the battery modules will be assembled into battery packs and used to power EVs in the United States.

In May, Toyota stated that it would manufacture its first EV assembled in the United States at its Kentucky plant in 2025. This EV would be among Toyota’s ten EVs scheduled to launch globally by 2026.

Tetsuo Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, said that the battery supply agreement is critical to meeting Toyota’s manufacturing and carbon reduction plans.

For Toyota, the ratio of electrified vehicles sold to total sales in fiscal 2023 was 29.6%. The company expects the ratio to increase to 37% in fiscal 2024.

The Japan-based auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from EVs by 2025 and 70% by 2030. The company plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) in a lineup of 30 BEVs by 2030. It aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 3.5 million units a year by 2030.

How the UAW's surprise strike may 'force Ford's hand' at ...,12-Oct-23,Yahoo Finance. How the UAW's surprise strike may 'force Ford's ... Ford  Motor Co. Kentucky Truck Plant in the early morning hours on Oct. 12 in...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-the-uaws-surprise-strike-may-force-fords-hand-at-bargaining-table-142842635.html,"A major surprise came for Ford (F) on Wednesday night, the 27th day of the United Auto Workers (UAW) stand-up strikes.
The UAW called an unplanned walkout at Ford’s sprawling Kentucky Truck Plant, a massive escalation because this plant builds Ford’s F-250 through F-550 super duty trucks, Expedition SUV, and Lincoln Navigator SUV. While the top selling F-150 was spared, Ford says Kentucky Truck plant is responsible for $25 billion in revenue annually.
The UAW said in a statement the strike at Kentucky Truck was called after Ford “refused to make further movement in bargaining,” marking a new phase for the stand up strikes. “If they can’t understand that after four weeks, the 8,700 workers shutting down this extremely profitable plant will help them understand it,” Fain said.

Ford’s response came quickly on Wednesday night: the automaker called the UAW’s latest move “grossly irresponsible,” but not surprising. The strike at Kentucky Truck “carries serious consequences for our workforce, suppliers, dealers and commercial customers,” the company added.
The UAW has 8,700 workers at Kentucky Truck. But Ford officials said the ripple effect from Kentucky Truck will impact dozens of other Ford operations and suppliers, which employ around 100,000 workers.
The financial impact, and pain point created by this move, is a big one.
“Targeting Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant hits some of the most expensive products they make, including the SuperDuty, which sells for as much as $100,000,” Sam Fiorani, auto industry expert at AutoForecast Solutions (AFS), told Yahoo Finance. “Expanding the strike to include this facility is meant to force Ford's hand and bring them to the table quicker.”

Fiorani, whose firm tracks auto production and plant productivity across the globe, says profits on vehicles at Kentucky Truck can easily top $10,000 per unit, making them among the most important in Ford's product portfolio.
“It is also a shot across the industry to tell GM and Stellantis to step up their game or else their big and profitable models would be targeted next,” Fiorani said.
Case in point: Last week the UAW did not expand strikes against the Big Three, as Fain said a major concession was made by GM (GM) — the automaker supposedly said it would allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to unionize. This was a major move as it would likely mean Ford and Stellantis (STLA) would have to agree to similar terms in the collective bargaining process as the entire industry transforms itself from gas-powered cars to electrified vehicles.
It’s possible Ford was not budging on its stance of not allowing unionization at its upcoming battery plants in Tennessee, and other locations. Whether this changes Ford’s calculus on its battery plants remains to be seen.
Stay tuned. Friday, the UAW is expected to announce its next steps.

Tesla (finally) releases updated Model 3 for  North American...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-strikes-signal-automotive-sector-164011725.html,"This week began with UAW workers at Volvo Group (OTC: VLVLY)-owned Mack Trucks also going on strike, joining the UAW’s targeted strike against the Detroit Three automakers. Since walking out on September 15th, the strike against General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford (NYSE: F) and Chrysler parent Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) gathered 25,000 employees which make about 17% of UAW members, covered by expired contracts with the Detroit automakers. Yet last week ended with UAW deciding not to expand strikes at Detroit’s big three automakers after a last-minute proposal that GM made.
GM Saved The Day
For the first time since the work stoppages began, the UAW decided not to expand the strike despite still not having reached a tentative agreement with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. UAW was about to shut down the GM-owned Arlington Assembly plant that produces highly profitable full-size SUVs when the automaker agreed to include battery cell workers under the company’s national agreement. Officially, because of being formed by joint ventures, the battery plants aren’t covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union. Therefore, this revolutionary decision GM made will undoubtedly put pressure on Ford and Stellantis.
Mack Trucks Union Members To Join Striking Detroit Autoworkers
As announced on Sunday night, 74% of UAW members rejected a tentative deal that was reached last week by the union and Mack Trucks as they felt it was significantly short of what UAW’s demanding in ongoing negotiations with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. As of 7 a.m. on Monday, about 3,900 workers from facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida are on strike. Although Mack Trucks is a separate company and a different part of the union compared to the section that covers members employed at the Detroit automakers, UAW workers were expecting similar increases and benefits as their peers.
The Strikes Are Harming A Very Lucrative Segment
The strikes already costed GM $200 million in the third quarter. With the walkouts and part shortages that idled production, they impacted the production of small and midsize pickups, as well as of SUVs. 2023 has been named as the year of the electric pickup before it even began with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) finally debuting its long-promised cybertruck. The strike also targeted parts distribution centers which means both dealerships and drivers could soon feel the impact.
At GM, Chevrolet and GMC midsize pickups, Chevrolet Traverse, Cadillac XT4, as well Buick Enclave SUVs and Chevrolet Malibu sedan were affect. The strikes also halted production of Ford-made Ranger midsize pickup, Ford Bronco, Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, along with Stellantis-made Jeep Wrangler SUV and Gladiator.
Yet, in West Seneca, NY, an automotive parts manufacturer is working full speed.
The tonneau cover specialist, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP), recently revealed it signed a long-term supply agreement for its hard-folding and soft-folding covers that could bring in $16 million in annual revenue. Worksport already has an order of $1.6 million for its hard-folding covers and another of $720,000 order for the soft-folding covers from the same customer.
More importantly, Worksport continues to develop revolutionary solar-powered accessories, the SOLIS tonneau cover and COR portable system that brought the attention of Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) who will be getting a customized version of these power-on-the-go tools. Hyundai is the latest automaker to adopt the Tesla charging system. By announcing the news on Thursday, Kia, Hyundai and Genesis, all part of the Hyundai Group, but with Hyundai and Kia operating as separate companies in the U.S., have joined General Motors, Ford, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTC: MBGAF), Nissan Motor Co (OTC: NSANF), Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC) and Volvo. According to figures from Kelley Blue Book, Hyundai, Kia and Genesis counted together make the second-best-selling EV manufacturer in the United States, right behind Tesla. Hyundai, Kia and Genesis sold 37,800 EVs during the first half of the year while Tesla sold more than 330,000, but this is still a big milestone for the NACS Tesla charging standard.
Catching up to Tesla who only continues to evolve is a daunting endeavor as the EV king is a moving target. The UAW strike will undoubtedly make it harder for GM, Ford and Stellantis to play the already costly EV game and cast a shadow on 2023’s pickup theme.

Market Dynamics
Impactful driver- Increased utility of pickup trucks
Key Trend - Increasing incorporation of lighter materials in pickup truck manufacturing
Major Challenges - High manufacturing cost of pickup trucks
Increased utility of pickup trucks is a key factor driving market growth. In comparison with hatchbacks and sedans, pickup trucks have become more popular because of their better value. In addition, they are suitable for both commercial and off-the-road use because of their increased trunk capacity as well as vehicle towing capacities. Also, for the purpose of offering passengers a premium experience, car companies are equipping pickup trucks with luxury exteriors. This is a reason why, in the US, families looking for convenient family cars to drive every day are more and more turning to pickup trucks. Hence, these factors are expected to drive market growth during the forecast period.
Market Segmentation
By Product, the market is classified into full-size pickup truck, small-size, and mid-size pickup truck. The full-size pickup truck segment is estimated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. Automakers sell many types of full-size pickup trucks because they offer better sales margins for dealers compared with small and midsized pickups. All pickups have a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 6,000 lbs to 14,000 Ibs considered a large pickup truck. A diesel variant of a full-size pickup truck, with increased capacity to haul or pick up weights, is offered by the auto manufacturers, in particular General Motors and Ford. Hence, these factors are expected to drive segment growth during the forecast period.

Tesla's (TSLA) EV Market Share Comes Down to 50% in Q3,13-Oct-23,Ford Motor Company F General Motors Company GM and Mercedes-Benz Group AG  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-tsla-ev-market-share-095200357.html,"Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA market share in the U.S. electric vehicles (EV) segment has come down to 50% in third-quarter 2023 from a much-vaunted 62% in the first quarter. EVs have been rapidly gaining ground since the pandemic years, and sales in the United States rose for the 13th straight quarter, as reported by Cox Automotive on Thursday. It is becoming abundantly clear that EVs are here to stay, and demand is rising by the day. Consumers are gradually shifting from cars run on fossil fuels to their environment-friendly alternatives.
The latest quarterly estimate shows a record 313,086 electric cars sold from July to September, breaching the 300,000 mark for the first time in the third quarter. EVs now account for 7.9% of total auto sales in the United States, up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% from the second quarter.
One of the biggest drivers of this growth in sales and rise in market share has been the slashing in prices led by Tesla. EV prices are down 22% from a year ago, and the average price paid in September was $50,683. Tesla models have been ahead of the market in cutting prices, with its current starting price at $38,880. High levels of inventory have also helped drive sales.
Even as Tesla’s market share comes down from its first-quarter peak, it is nonetheless expected that with the launch of its much-awaited electric pickup vehicle Cybertruck, the Elon Musk-led automobile giant can reverse the downward trend. Tesla currently carries a Zacks #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Ford Motor Company F, General Motors Company GM and Mercedes-Benz Group AG MBGAF are three other automobile majors that have emerged as the leading lights in the American EV segment. While Ford and General Motors have sold more electric cars in the quarter — 20,962 and 20,092 vehicles, respectively — the Germany-based Mercedes group has led the automakers in the U.S. market with 15%. GM, Ford and Mercedes currently carry a Zacks #4 (Sell), #3 and #2 (Buy), respectively.
There are many other EV makers who are vying for a share of the pie. The Swedish automaker Volvo, for instance, has seen a staggering growth of 650% over its year-ago sales in this quarter. Volvo expects further growth with its new models EX30 and EX90.
In the near term, it will be essential to follow this space to check the emergence of newer, non-traditional automakers that have entered the EV space, not because they were already building cars but with a vision for the future.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, Honda HMC, Toyota TM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA.
Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:
Q3 U.S. Auto Sales in Focus: Will the Momentum Continue?
The U.S. auto market continued to ride the recovery wave in the third quarter of 2023 on improving retail inventories and strong fleet shipments. Many auto biggies, including General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Volvo, among others registered double-digit percentage sales growth year over year, thanks to pent-up demand as the industry continues to rebound from the pandemic and chip crunch.
Per Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year. The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier, per GlobalData.
Q3 U.S. Sales Figures of Major Automakers
General Motors' third-quarter sales in the United States rose 21% year over year to 674,336 units. Volumes at key brands namely Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC increased 21%, 6%, 54% and 19%, respectively. GM's closest peer Ford saw its sales increase 7.7% to 500,504 units. Sales of the Ford brand rose 8%, while that of Lincoln increased 1.8%. The third quarter of 2023 marked record electric vehicle sales for Ford on the soaring popularity of Mustang Mach-E and E Transit.
Ford currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Stellantis, however, saw a 1% decrease in third-quarter volume with 380,563 units sold. While sales of Jeep, RAM, Dodge, Fiat and Alpha Romeo brands declined 4%, 4%, 23%, 30% and 16%, respectively, Chrysler sales rocketed 96% year over year.
Japan's auto giant Toyota experienced a 12.2% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales in the September quarter, reaching a total of 590,296 vehicles. The namesake brand witnessed a 12.4% rise, while Lexus saw 10.9% growth in sales. TM's closest peer, Honda's total sales saw a significant surge of 40.6%, with a total of 339,143 units sold. Both the Honda and Acura brands experienced impressive year-over-year growth, with sales rising 38.3% and 69.3%, respectively.
Sales of Subaru increased 18.8%, while that of Mazda and Nissan jumped around 22% and 40%, respectively. Volkswagen and BMW's sales were up 6.5% and 7.8% respectively. Sales of Hyundai and Kia increased 10.2% and 13.8%, respectively. Sales of Kia grew 23.4% year over year for the month.
Inventory Position
At the beginning of September, U.S. inventories amounted to 2.2 million vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 813,000 cars and light trucks compared to September 2022, according to Cox Automotive.
Despite a UAW strike against Detroit's three automakers (which began on Sep 15) and robust sales, the total inventory reached 2.21 million units as of Oct 2, 2023. This marks a 60% increase from the year-ago levels and the highest new-vehicle inventory since early 2021. However, it is still 35% lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
Inventory remains relatively stable overall. Most Detroit automakers, except for certain GM models, have sufficient inventory to support operations for about a month. Some brands are experiencing inventory build-up, which will take time to affect the distribution network. However, prolonged strike action could have more pronounced effects in the coming weeks.
General Motors reported its highest inventory of new vehicles on dealer lots since 2020 at the end of the third quarter. However, GM's Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have the lowest inventory among the Detroit automakers, making them more vulnerable to a protracted strike, with supply levels below the industry average. Chevrolet is at 57 days' supply, and Cadillac is at 46. They were already below average before the strike. Interestingly, Chevrolet and Cadillac models, with the tightest supply, are often the most popular ones and the biggest profit generators for GM. Its other brands, such as Buick and GMC, have higher stock levels.
Stellantis is in a better position, with ample supply across its four volume brands. Dodge and Chrysler have the highest days' supply among all brands, at 142 and 127, respectively. Ram and Jeep, too, have a high supply. The strike has had a minor impact on Jeep models produced at the Toledo, OH plant, with the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator having 77- and 116-day supply, respectively.
Ford's inventory varies among its brands and models. Lincoln has the highest days' supply among luxury brands at 124. Ford brand is at 88 days' supply, with the F-150 at 97 days' supply at the start of October. However, strikes have affected models like the Explorer, Bronco, and Ranger. Besides a few disruptions, Ford maintains ample stock for other models, including the Escape and Bronco Sport.
Incentives & Average Transaction Prices
The generous incentives offered by automakers played a crucial role in boosting retail deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, offsetting the impact of high interest rates. In September, the average new vehicle incentive was projected to rise to $1,806 from $999 in September 2022, with truck and SUV incentives at $1,921 (up $889) and car incentives at $1,340 (up $470), per J.D.

The average cost of a new vehicle in the United States is high, around $47,000. Despite the Federal Reserve pausing its rate hikes in August and September, average interest rates for new-vehicle loans are now around 9%, marking their highest point in 23 years, according to Cox Automotive.
Moody's Analytics estimates that the average American household now needs 42 weeks of income to afford a new light vehicle, a significant increase from 33 weeks required just three years ago.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox Automotive, foresees demand for new vehicles to be constrained by the combination of elevated pricing and high interest rates.
Final Thoughts
The outlook for fourth-quarter U.S. auto sales is dependent on the evolving dynamics of the UAW strike against the Detroit 3 automakers — F, GM and STLA — and its duration. Thus far, the strike has had a relatively minimal impact on dealer inventory, sales, or pricing. However, the situation could change in the coming weeks and months if the strike persists. A prolonged strike would likely result in reduced new-car inventory for the affected brands and potentially higher transaction prices, particularly if demand surpasses supply.
Despite the U.S. auto industry's steady progress in boosting production and new vehicle inventory throughout the year, the strike could undo these gains. Although high interest rates are yet to deter consumer demand for vehicles, affordability concerns could eventually impede further growth. There's a palpable unease that the recovery momentum may stall once pent-up demand is adequately met.

By David Shepardson
Oct 13 (Reuters) -
Ford Motor said on Friday it will temporarily cut one of three shifts at the Michigan plant that builds its electric F-150 lightning pickup truck, citing multiple constraints, including supply chain issues.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said the cuts are unrelated to the United Auto Workers strike. Ford said the move takes effect Monday and would affect about 700 jobs. It said it will rotate the shift that is being cut, and did not say how long the production cut would last.
Ford said it was ""working through processing and delivering vehicles held for quality checks after restarting production in August.""
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that a UAW official said in a memo that Ford was considering canceling a shift citing slowing demand and indicated that the company was looking to build more gasoline-powered trucks instead. ""It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that our sales for the Lightning have tanked,"" the memo said, according to the newspaper.
Ford declined to comment on the memo.
The automaker said last week F-150 EV U.S. sales fell 46% in three months ending Sept. 30 to 3,503 but are still up 40% over 2022 for the first nine months. F-150 EVs account for about 2% of all Ford F-series sales.

Samsung SDI Stellantis choose Indiana for second joint EV ...,11-Oct-23,Fain who joined the UAW as a worker at one of Chrysler's Kokomo powertrain  plants is demanding that Stellantis General Motors and Ford ... Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-sdi-stellantis-choose-indiana-100842224.html,"By Heekyong Yang and Joseph White
SEOUL (Reuters) -Stellantis and South Korea's Samsung SDI Co Ltd on Wednesday said they will build a second electric vehicle battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana, the hometown of United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain.
The union leader is currently fighting with the Detroit Three automakers over union representation of new battery factories. The UAW had no immediate comment about the announcement.
Stellantis and SDI said their second joint battery factory in Indiana is scheduled to open in 2027, and could employ 1,400 workers. The two companies would have a combined annual production capacity of 67 gigawatt hours (GWh) at the Indiana production site, Samsung SDI said in a statement.
The first joint plant is set to start production in the first quarter of 2025.
The announcement comes as Stellantis, the parent of Detroit's Chrysler, Jeep and Ram truck brands, is coping with losses from nearly four weeks of strikes by the United Auto Workers at a Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, and parts depots around the United States.
Fain, who joined the UAW as a worker at one of Chrysler's Kokomo powertrain plants, is demanding that Stellantis, General Motors and Ford Motor Co bring their joint venture EV battery factories under the union's master agreements with the automakers.
Stellantis and Ford have so far resisted, saying the battery ventures are separate entities that need lower labor costs.
GM on Friday agreed to bring its joint venture battery operations under its master contract but the UAW and the automaker have not disclosed details of the agreement, including how much battery plant workers would be paid.
UAW-represented workers at GM's joint venture battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in August won raises averaging 25% and now earn $20 an hour, still well below the $32-an-hour top wage at GM assembly plants.
For Stellantis, a second U.S. battery plant would help the company comply with U.S. Inflation Reduction Act domestic content rules that govern federal EV subsidies.
Samsung SDI last month said it plans to invest 2.7 trillion won ($2.01 billion) to build its second joint battery plant with Stellantis.
Stellantis, whose brands include Peugeot, Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Citroen and Opel, has announced plans to reach 100% electric passenger car sales in Europe and 50% car and light truck electric mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve that, it has said it wants to secure about 400 GWh of battery capacity.
On top of the two facilities announced in Indiana, Stellantis will build a gigafactory in Canada with South Korea's LG Energy Solution 373220.KS (LGES).
In Europe, Stellantis has already inaugurated its first gigafactory in France, with two more to follow in Germany and Italy, all through its ACC joint venture with TotalEnergies and Mercedes, for a total capacity in the region of 120 GWh.

Japanese automaker Toyota and energy company Idemitsu to ...,12-Oct-23,and American manufacturer Ford Motor Co. But some technological challenges  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japanese-automaker-toyota-energy-company-072818519.html,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s top automaker Toyota agreed Thursday to work with Idemitsu, a major Japanese oil company, on technology for mass production of solid-state batteries that promise to be a key component in future electric vehicles.
The deal is an important step for Toyota Motor Corp., which has promised to speed up its battery EV offerings and catch up after having fallen behind rivals like Tesla and China's BYD. Toyota lags partly because of its success in hybrids, like the Prius, that are equipped with both gasoline engines and battery-powered motors.
Toyota, with its production finesse, and Idemitsu, which owns technologies in materials, said they are aiming for successful commercialization of all-solid-state batteries in 2027 or 2028, followed by full-scale mass production.
“With repeated efforts involving trial and error, we have succeeded in developing a material that is more stable and less prone to crack,” Toyota Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters in Tokyo, after shaking hands with his counterpart at Idemitsu.
“The future of mobility lies in the tie-up between the auto and energy sectors, including this innovation hailing from Japan,” he said.
Solid-state batteries are widely believed to be essential for mass commercialization of battery-powered EVs. The lithium-ion batteries whose components are liquid are now commonly used in electric vehicles, but are prone to fires. Solid-state batteries are more stable and potentially more powerful, but generally more expensive.
“The era of the solid-state battery is right around the corner,” said Idemistu Kosan Co. Chief Executive Shunichi Kito.
Idemitsu has been researching basic technologies for all-solid-state batteries since 2001. Toyota started in 2006. Kito said recent innovations will help the batteries now in the works overcome the edge lithium-ion batteries have had over EVs.
The collaboration focuses on sulfide solid electrolytes, materials that are soft, adhesive and suitable for mass production, the companies said. Kito said Idemitsu developed mass production technology related to sulfide solid electrolytes by studying by-products from petroleum refining.
The companies plan a large pilot facility to develop sulfide solid electrolytes, paying special attention to quality and costs. Mass production would follow.
Many of the world’s top automakers are working on solid-state batteries, including domestic rival Nissan Motor Co. and American manufacturer Ford Motor Co. But some technological challenges remain.
Toyota, which makes the Lexus luxury models and Camry sedan, had said it will offer a commercial solid-state battery as soon as 2027, with charging time, one of the main drawbacks of electric vehicles, shortened to 10 minutes or less.
It’s planning to deliver 1.5 million EVs in 2026 by expanding its battery EV lineup.

Ford Motor's estimated fair value is US$12.32 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Ford Motor's US$11.64 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate
The US$15.11 analyst price target for F is 23% more than our estimate of fair value
How far off is Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
Crunching The Numbers
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 12%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (12%– 2.2%) = US$60b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$60b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$19b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$49b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$11.6, the company appears about fair value at a 5.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

The Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Ford Motor
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.
Looking Ahead:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Ford Motor, there are three fundamental items you should look at:
Risks: Take risks, for example - Ford Motor has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share, indicating a change of +33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.05 points to a change of +9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.6%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.89 indicates a change of -8% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.48 billion and $159.08 billion estimates indicate +7.7% and -0.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $42.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.09 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.83%. The EPS surprise was +41.18%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Ford names Galhotra head of internal combustion engines ...,18-Oct-23,On Monday Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford called on autoworkers  to ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-names-galhotra-head-internal-162117457.html,"Ford has named longtime executive Kumar Galhotra as its chief operating officer with the automaker in the midst of a potentially damaging strike.
Galhotra will lead Ford's global industrial system, the company said Wednesday, where he will now oversee all global vehicle engineering and cycle planning, ICE and hybrid programs, supply chain management, and manufacturing of vehicles on behalf of all business units. He will report to CEO Jim Farley.
Galhotra, who joined Ford in 1988, most recently was in charge of Ford Blue, the company’s internal combustion engine business. Andrew Frick will succeed Galhotra in that role. Frick had been managing Ford Blue’s sales and distribution functions; trucks, SUVs and enthusiast vehicles; and operations in Mexico and Canada.
Prior to serving as president of Ford Blue, Galhotra was president of Ford Americas and the company’s International Markets Group, with responsibilities including profitability of those business units, according to Ford's website. He's also served as president, North America, leading all aspects of Ford's business in the region. In addition, Galhotra has served as group vice president, Lincoln, and Ford’s chief marketing officer.
On Monday Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford called on autoworkers to come together to end a monthlong strike that he says could cost the company the ability to invest in the future.
In a rare speech coming during contract talks in the company’s hometown of Dearborn, Michigan, Ford said high labor costs could limit spending on developing new vehicles and investing in factories.
The company is near an impasse with the United Auto Workers union, which walked out in targeted strikes at all three Detroit automakers, which also include General Motors and Stellantis, on Sept. 15.

Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford calls on autoworkers to end ...,16-Oct-23,Auto Workers Strike Ford. Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman Bill Ford  delivers remarks on the future of American manufacturing Monday Oct. 16  2023 in...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-executive-chairman-bill-ford-134403370.html,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford on Monday called on autoworkers to come together to end a monthlong strike that he says could cost the company the ability to invest in the future.
In a rare speech coming during contract talks in the company's hometown of Dearborn, Michigan, Ford said high labor costs could limit spending on developing new vehicles and investing in factories.
“It’s the absolute lifeblood of our company. And if we lose it, we will lose to the competition. America loses. Many jobs will be lost,” said the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford.
The company, he said, builds more vehicles in America and has more United Auto Workers employees than any company, which has increased its costs in a highly competitive industry.
Ford has 57,000 UAW workers compared with 46,000 at GM and 43,000 at Stellantis. “Many of our competitors moved jobs to Mexico as we added jobs here in the U.S.,” Ford said.
The company is near an impasse with the United Auto Workers union, which walked out in targeted strikes at all three Detroit automakers on Sept. 15,
Last week 8,700 union members walked out at the largest and most profitable Ford plant in the world, the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.
Ford said the strike at the Kentucky plant is harming tens of thousands of Americans who work for parts suppliers and Ford dealers. The strike also could cause a fragile parts supply base to collapse, he said. “If it continues, it will have a major impact on the American economy and devastate local communities,” he said.
Bill Ford, only the fourth family member to lead the 120-year-old company, said he has watched other countries lose their auto industries, then all of their manufacturing base. He said strong American manufacturing is essential for national security.
“We need to come together to bring an end to this acrimonious round of talks,” Ford said. “I still believe in a bright future — one that we can build together. I still believe the automobile industry is a major force for good in our country. We will continue to be there when America needs us most.”
Last week, after the Kentucky strike began, a top Ford executive said on a conference call with reporters that Ford had reached the limit in how much it was willing to spend to end the strike.
UAW President Shawn Fain said that Bill Ford knows he can settle the strike by calling CEO Jim Farley and telling him “to stop playing games and get a deal done.""
He threatened to strike and close Ford's Rouge truck complex in Dearborn. “It’s not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It’s autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed,"" Fain said in a statement.
At the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, west of Detroit, few workers are on the picket lines Monday afternoon said they listened to Ford’s speech.
When told what Ford said about investing in the future, line worker Steve Applebee said he agreed. “I get that,” he said. “I can see both sides.”
But he also said Ford is paying CEO Farley $21 million per year when starting pay for Ford factory workers is up only about $3 per hour from when he started with the company 31 years ago.
Ford’s offer of a 23% general wage increase barely covers inflation over the last three or four years, said Applebee, 59.
Carlos Hollins 47, of Detroit, who just started with Ford in July and is at the low end of the pay scale, said workers gave up raises in 2008 when Ford and the others were in financial trouble. They were promised that concessions would be restored when the company recovered.
“We shouldn’t have to suffer, especially for the retirees,” he said. “They need to pay us what we deserve.”
The union has said retirees haven’t received a pension increase for at least a decade.
Hollins said workers should get everything they are asking for, and Ford has enough money to pay it.
The speech from Ford arrives with the entire auto industry making a historic and expensive shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles.
Fain has said Ford and crosstown rivals General Motors and Jeep maker Stellantis are making billions in profits, and that workers should get a share. He says the workers should be repaid for sacrificing general pay raises, cost of living adjustments and agreeing to lower wage tiers to keep the companies afloat during the Great Recession.
The union began striking at targeted factories after its contracts with the companies expired. It started picketing one assembly plant from each company, but that has since spread to 38 parts warehouses at GM and Jeep maker Stellantis. The UAW later added another assembly plant at both GM and Ford and on Wednesday, Fain made the surprise announcement that the union would walk out at the Kentucky plant, which makes Super Duty pickups and large Ford and Lincoln SUVs.
About 34,000 of the union's 146,000 employees at all three automakers are now on strike.
The seemingly widening labor rift suggests Ford and the union may be in for a lengthy strike that could cost the company and its workers billions of dollars.
The union has said Ford’s general wage offer is up to 23% over four years and that it has reinstated cost of living raises. GM and Stellantis were at 20%. But Fain said none is high enough.","{'negative': 0.8068703537185987, 'neutral': 0.7381999492645264, 'positive': 0.7234036723772684}",0.7381999492645264,0.7234036723772684,0.8068703537185987

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday a proposal by President Joe Biden's administration to hike vehicle fuel economy standards through 2032 threatens to cause ""substantial economic hardship"" for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.
Ford's comments represent the latest attack by the auto industry on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal announced in July to increase vehicle fuel efficiency requirements by 2% per year for passenger cars and 4% per year for pickup trucks and SUVs from 2027 through 2032.
The agency made the proposal as Biden's administration seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and to reduce fuel use. The proposal would result in a fleet-wide average fuel efficiency of 58 miles (93 km) per gallon. NHTSA is due to make a final decision by early next year.
In a filing with NHTSA during the public comment period for the proposed regulation, Ford cited NHTSA estimates that the automaker would face $1 billion in civil penalties through 2032 under these changes in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program.
""This is alarming in and of itself, and threatens substantial economic hardship for Ford,"" the company said of the estimated civil penalties, calling NHTSA's proposal not feasible and adding that the plan does not provide a level playing field for all automakers.
""We see substantial risk of unprecedented civil penalties in the CAFE program,"" Ford said.
The company called for cutting in half NHTSA's proposed fuel efficiency hikes for SUVs and trucks, echoing the position taken on Monday by the American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing the Detroit Three automakers - Ford, General Motors and Stellantis unit Chrysler.
On Tuesday, electric car maker Tesla urged NHTSA to finalize much tougher fuel economy standards calling for increasing stringency for cars by 6% annually and 8% for trucks and SUVs. Tesla sells credits to other automakers to help them meet government vehicle emissions requirements. Higher CAFE credits could force automakers to buy more such credits to meet tougher requirements.
U.S. automakers previously said the fines would cost GM $6.5 billion, Stellantis $3 billion and Ford $1 billion, citing NHTSA's projections and its $13.7 billion estimate for the industry as a whole.
In June, Reuters first reported that Stellantis and GM paid a total of $363 million in CAFE fines. Ford noted that it has never had to pay CAFE fines.
NHTSA last year reinstated sharp increases in penalties. The agency has said it is prohibited when making penalty projections from considering electric vehicles, and flexibilities like credit trading. It added that its proposal ""is focused on saving Americans money at the gas pump and strengthening American energy independence.""

3 Auto Stocks to Watch for Q3 Earnings Surprise,20-Oct-23,Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote ... Yahoo  Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us  · Terms and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-auto-stocks-watch-q3-124500578.html,"The third-quarter earnings season for the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector began on Oct 18. So far, two S&P 500 sector components — Tesla TSLA and Genuine Parts GPC — have reported quarterly numbers. Electric vehicle (EV) king Tesla’s 10 consecutive quarter-long beat streak snapped as it reported lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of 2023. Revenues also lagged estimates. Auto replacement parts provider Genuine Parts topped earnings estimate but missed the mark for sales.
Per the Earnings Trend report dated Oct 18, the auto sector’s earnings for the third quarter are expected to decline 12.2% on a year-over-year basis. As for revenues, they are estimated to grow 5.8% year over year.
With a majority of companies left to release third-quarter 2023 results, we have identified — with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener — a few auto players, which are positioned to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These include PACCAR Inc. PCAR, Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and Ford F. Before we discuss the companies, let’s take a look at the factors shaping the quarterly performance of automotive companies.
Factors at Play
Per Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year. The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier, per GlobalData. Improving retail inventories and strong fleet shipments aided the U.S. auto market in the third quarter.
At the beginning of September, U.S. inventories had 2.2 million vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 813,000 cars and light trucks compared to September 2022, according to Cox Automotive. This marked a 60% increase from the year-ago levels and the highest new-vehicle inventory since early 2021.
The generous incentives offered by automakers are expected to have played a crucial role in boosting retail deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, offsetting the impact of high interest rates. However, discounts might have impacted margins. Also, commodity costs, forex woes, tough labor market and logistical challenges are likely to have played spoilsport. Moreover, high operating expenses, including R&D to develop technologically advanced products to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auto industry, are expected to have dented earnings.
Picking Potential Winners
While it is not possible to be sure about which companies are well positioned to beat earnings estimates, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, the chances of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.
Our Choices
PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business, with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup (comprising the XF, XG and XD models) and accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance are likely to have bolstered third-quarter results.
We expect truck deliveries of 51,421 units during the quarter under discussion, which reflects 15.8% growth year over year.  While PACCAR derives the bulk of its revenues from truck sales, it also produces and sells a wide range of parts, including its brand of engines. Continued growth in aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and less cyclic business — bodes well. Our projections for Trucks and Parts revenues imply year-over-year growth of 22.2% and 7.2%, respectively.
PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.07 per share and $8.02 billion, respectively. The EPS estimate for the third quarter has moved by a cent in the past seven days. PCAR surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 15.21%.

Allison is a manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions for medium and heavy-duty commercial and heavy-tactical U.S. defense vehicles. The strategic buyouts of Walker Die, C&R Tool & Engineering, Vantage Power, the Off-Highway transmission portfolio of AVTEC and AxleTech’s EV systems division are likely to aid Allison’s third-quarter results. Regular product launches, including FracTran, TerraTran and the 3414 Regional Haul Series fully automatic transmission, bode well.
The eGen Flex portfolio and the eGen Force portfolio demonstrate its ability to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auto industry and are expected to have driven third-quarter revenues. Our estimate for the company’s North America On-Highway — which accounts for the bulk of its revenues — is pegged at around $368 million, implying year-over-year growth of 8.3%.
Allison has an Earnings ESP of +8.19% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALSN’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.71 per share and $759.2 billion, respectively. The EPS estimate for the third quarter has moved by a cent in the past seven days. ALSN surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 19.32%.

Ford, one of the leading automakers in the United States, saw its US sales increase 7.7% to 500,504 units. Sales of the Ford brand rose 8%, while that of Lincoln increased 1.8%. The third quarter of 2023 marked record electric vehicle sales for Ford on the soaring popularity of Mustang Mach-E and E Transit.
For the to-be-reported quarter, our estimate for Ford Blue wholesale shipments is pegged at 750,000 units, indicating an increase of 1.2% from the year-ago period. The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for promising results of the Ford Pro segment. Our forecast for third-quarter Ford Blue and Ford Pro adjusted EBIT implies an uptick of 6.2% and a whopping 370.1% on a year-over-year basis.
Ford has an Earnings ESP of +14.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 40 cents per share and $37.83 billion, respectively. The EPS estimate for the third quarter has moved by 6 cents in the past 90 days. Ford surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average surprise being 20.11%.

Tesla joins GM Ford in slowing EV factory ramp as demand ...,18-Oct-23,SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla on Wednesday joined General Motors and Ford  in ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-joins-gm-ford-slowing-021424340.html,"By Abhirup Roy and Ben Klayman
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla on Wednesday joined General Motors and Ford in being cautious about expanding electric vehicle (EV) production capacity, citing economic uncertainties and underscoring fears of a slowdown in demand.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he was worried that higher borrowing costs would prevent potential customers from affording its vehicles despite substantial price cuts, and that he would wait for clarity on the economy before ramping up its planned factory in Mexico.
""People hesitate to buy a new car if there's uncertainty in the economy,"" Musk said on a post-earnings call where he also talked about ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" pressures on American workers. ""I don't want to be going into top speed into uncertainty.""
Musk's comments came after warning bells from other automakers and EV startups. It sent shares of Tesla down 8% Thursday as well as shares of other EV makers.
GM said on Tuesday it would delay production by a year of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickup trucks at a plant in Michigan, citing flattening demand for EVs.
Detroit peer Ford said last week it would temporarily cut one of three shifts at the plant that builds its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. The automaker in July slowed its EV ramp-up, shifting investment to commercial vehicles and hybrids.
EV startups Lucid and Rivian were also both lower Thursday, losing more than 3% each.
Lucid on Tuesday reported a near 30% plunge in third-quarter production and only a marginal increase in deliveries despite big discounts, raising worries about demand for its Air luxury sedan.
Rivian, which makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, also disappointed investors this month when it shied away from raising its full-year production forecast despite stronger-than-expected third-quarter numbers.
""It does highlight that there could be a slowdown in EV (demand) in the near term,"" said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""But it has more to do with pricing and affordability than a rejection of EVs.""
Narayan said he expected this to be a ""dip"" that improves as prices of EVs fall and lower-priced variants are available.
Automakers have billions of dollars in EV-related investments riding on how the next several quarters play out. Worries about slowing demand have been rising just as companies come to grips with supply chain constraints that wrecked production plans.
Reuters reported in July that the U.S. market was not growing fast enough to prevent unsold EVs from stacking up at some auto dealerships.
To prevent demand from waning, market leader Tesla, with industry-leading profit margins, has been the first and most aggressive in slashing prices, forcing others to follow suit and squeezing margins.
But Musk said higher financing costs due to rising interest rates meant to fight stubbornly high inflation in some cases almost entirely offset the price reductions, making consumers looking to shift away from gas-guzzling vehicles wary.
""If interest rates remain high ... it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can't afford it,"" Musk said, adding he would ""accelerate"" expansion of the Mexico factory if interest rates come down.
That is not expected in the United States until June 2024, based on current market estimates, with recent robust economic data suggesting the central bank might leave interest rates higher for longer.

US manufacturing output rises solidly in September,17-Oct-23,The United Auto Workers (UAW) union embarked on limited strikes at  factories owned by General Motors Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis in  mid-September.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-manufacturing-output-rises-solidly-135706835.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Production at US factories increased more than expected in September despite strikes in the automobile industry curbing motor vehicle output, further evidence that the economy exited the third quarter with momentum.
Manufacturing output rose 0.4% last month, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. Data for August was revised lower to show production at factories dipping 0.1% instead of nudging up 0.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory output would tick up 0.1%.
Production dropped 0.8% on a year-on-year basis in September. It was unchanged in the third quarter. Durable goods manufacturing output rose at a 2.3% annualized rate, which was offset by a 2.4% pace of decline in nondurable manufacturing.
Motor vehicle and parts output rose 0.3% last month after declining 4.1% in August.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union embarked on limited strikes at factories owned by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis in mid-September. The industrial action has since broadened out, shutting down Ford's truck plant in Kentucky last week.
Despite last month's strong showing, manufacturing remains constrained by slowing demand for goods because of higher interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.
Manufacturing accounts for 11.1% of the economy. But the worst for the sector is likely over, with the Institute for Supply Management's measure of national factory activity rising to a 10-month high in September.
Last month, there were solid increases in the production of wood, primary metals, plastics and rubber products. But output of apparel and leather as well as printing and support goods declines.
Mining output rose 0.4% after gaining 0.2% in August. Utilities production fell 0.3% after increasing 0.7% in the prior month. Overall industrial production rose 0.3% in September after being unchanged in August.
Industrial output increased at a 2.5% rate in the third quarter. That followed a 0.7% growth pace in the second quarter.
Capacity utilization for the industrial sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.2 percentage point to 79.7% in September. It is now equal to its 1972–2022 average. The operating rate for the manufacturing sector nudged up to 77.8% from 77.7% in the prior month and is 0.4 percentage point below its long-run average.

Institutions' substantial holdings in Medtronic implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price
The top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company
Recent sales by insiders
A look at the shareholders of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.5% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.8% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Medtronic which might hurt individual investors.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Medtronic.
Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Medtronic does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Medtronic, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
Insider Ownership Of Medtronic
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Medtronic plc. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$44m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Medtronic. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Medtronic .
But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo  Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-adopt-tesla-ev-charging-202231091.html,"(Reuters) -Japan's Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by sales, said on Thursday it had signed an agreement to adopt Tesla's electric-vehicle charging technology from 2025.
Ford Motor, General Motors and Nissan are among the other automakers that have adopted Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS), taking the Elon Musk-led company's superchargers closer to becoming the industry standard at the expense of the rival Combined Charging System (CCS).
The Japanese automaker will incorporate the NACS ports into certain Toyota and Lexus battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), including the new Toyota SUV that will be assembled at its manufacturing plant in Kentucky.
Existing owners of Toyota and Lexus vehicles equipped with CCS will be offered access to an adapter to enable NACS charging, also starting 2025.
Tesla's NACS is widely available, with the U.S. Department of Energy saying they make up about 60% of the fast chargers in the United States.
The rival CCS system is backed by automakers including Volkswagen, though the German company has held talks with Tesla about adopting the NACS.

Jim Farley: Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers. I’m so pleased for our employees. This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants. I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work. Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business. Right now, we’re focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers.
It’s been a challenging situation, for sure. Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions. But I am more excited and motivated than ever. Our team is making tremendous progress every day toward building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services. We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers. We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation.
We’re building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability. We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution. In a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed. The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results. But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business. Now, last week, we made some important leadership changes. Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, chief EV, digital, and design officer, to move us forward.
I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A. These are my top two priorities. Overall, we see – we are seeing the clear benefits of creating three distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro. The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength. Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid. Ford is America’s best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator. In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S. will be new and refreshed next year.
I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market. In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that’s based on it continued to gain share in international markets. So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come. We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is moving – is a moving target. I’m optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice. I’ve been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we’re working on.
Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career. Let me be specific. Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office. Take the wheels off this truck, and it’s still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized. I’d take this truck seven days of the week over a Cybertruck. A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost. Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y. They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second- and third-cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction.
While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs. The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries. So, let’s double-click on each of these three. On scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation. We’re leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality. We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability. Yep, we’re designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team.
On vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change. We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford. In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%. This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure, will allow us to significantly reduce material cost. Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you’ve seen our competitors struggle as they build out and ramp up these capabilities. So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey. And finally, batteries. They’re the single biggest cost component of any EV.
Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range. And with our LFP batteries, we’ll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S. Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability. These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024. And this is also a significant cost reduction. I saved Ford Pro for the last because it’s a massive driver of Ford’s growth and profitability.
Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we’ve built over many decades for our Pro business won’t be easy to cross. The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions. Our commercial order banks are healthy. This may be a surprise to everyone. We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects. Thank you, 5G and roadworks. And we have very loyal customers. Fleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year’s orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total.
In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe. Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe. It’s a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe. And it’s a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there. When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear. Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course. And we’re building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality. This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations. And I’ve asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business.
His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability. He’s already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers. There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro. I want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction. The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete, and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable. We are now expanding China’s role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro. We’ve already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia.
There is so much more opportunity ahead for us. Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln. Finally, I’m so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro. Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software. There’s simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us.
Peter, over to you.
Peter Stern: Thanks, Jim. I’ve spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy. As you said, it’s literally the plus in Ford+. Now, over two months in, I’m even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that’s working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments. We’re making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating.
Over the past couple of months, we’ve identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers’ lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise. This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before. It will drive new high margin, cyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers. And we’ll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice. Whether you choose to add our services or not, you’ll have an amazing vehicle. Our momentum around software and services is building fast.
Here are three examples. First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford’s industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership. Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past six months, both contributing to strong revenue growth. And we’re still in the early stages of our rollout. We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year over year. And we have an ambitious product road map for Pro. For example, over the next few weeks, we’ll launch the Ford Pro dashcam.
This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving. While we’re still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we’ll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford. Second, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services. This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts. So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off. And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today.
Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day. If you haven’t felt what it’s like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it. Launch to date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles. That’s the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well. Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving. And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0. BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, five times longer than version 1.0. Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof.
Despite these encouraging successes, what we’re about to do in Integrated Services won’t be easy. Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected. We must also round out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies. Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer. We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers. And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies but also new measures of success.
So, as we progress in our services evolution, you’re going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription. And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits. There’s incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I’m proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history. John, over to you.
John Lawler: Thanks, Peter. Through the first three quarters, we delivered 9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business. Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion. With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects.
And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant. This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly 1.3 billion. Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance. So, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again – it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future. Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient.
Whole sales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was 2.2 billion with a margin of 5%. Both improved year over year. However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost. Adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion in the quarter, down year over year, driven by unfavorable working capital. Through the first nine months, we generated 4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range. Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption.
We ended the quarter with over 29 billion in cash and 50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new 4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment. Now, turning to our customer-focused segments. Ford Pro generated EBIT of 1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%. Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that’s reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power. In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years.
We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter. Regarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred 1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products. Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand. For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky. And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward.
In fact, all told, we have pushed about 12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense. The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market. Turning to Ford Blue. In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of 1.7 billion, up 300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs. The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation. Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success. Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we’ve had in place now for almost two decades.
We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the U.S, thanks to Maverick and F-150. We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies. The F-150 Powerboost hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they have more – they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains. And hybrids aren’t just limited to North America as we are launching a Ranger for Europe and IMG next year. Ford Credit generated EBIT of 358 million. As expected, our results were down year over year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but continues to normalize.
Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations. Finally, turning to software and services. We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and, most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation. In closing, there’s obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I’m confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business.
So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We’ll use the balance of the time to address what’s on your minds. Thank you, and operator, please open the line for questions.

Should You Be Worried About Ford Motor Company's (NYSE ...,25-Oct-23,Should You Be Worried About Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) 9.2% Return On  Equity? ... Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos ·  Yahoo Finance...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-ford-motor-companys-nyse-130022843.html,"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), by way of a worked example.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ford Motor is:
9.2% = US$4.0b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.
Does Ford Motor Have A Good ROE?
One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Ford Motor has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Auto industry.
roe
That's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Ford Motor.
How Does Debt Impact ROE?
Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.
Combining Ford Motor's Debt And Its 9.2% Return On Equity
It appears that Ford Motor makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.28. Most investors would need a low share price to be interested in a company with low ROE and high debt to equity.
Conclusion
Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.
But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.
Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.

Is a Surprise Coming for Ford (F) This Earnings Season?,25-Oct-23,Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote. Why is  this ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surprise-coming-ford-f-earnings-123400519.html,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ford Motor Company F may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Ford is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for F in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 46 cents per share for F, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for F, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +14.57% heading into earnings season.

Why is this Important?
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that F has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ford, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Only Four Days Left To Cash In On Ford Motor's (NYSE:F ...,26-Oct-23,Readers hoping to buy Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) for its dividend will  need to make ... Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos  · Yahoo...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-four-days-left-cash-144604616.html,"Readers hoping to buy Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Ford Motor's shares on or after the 31st of October, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of December.
The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.60 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Ford Motor has a trailing yield of approximately 5.2% on its current stock price of $11.54. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Ford Motor can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Check out our latest analysis for Ford Motor
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Ford Motor paid out more than half (58%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ford Motor generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 94% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.
Ford Motor paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Ford Motor's ability to maintain its dividend.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Ford Motor's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 12% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Ford Motor has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.1% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.
The Bottom Line
Should investors buy Ford Motor for the upcoming dividend? It's definitely not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The company paid out an acceptable percentage of its income, but an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow over the past year. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.
With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Ford Motor don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. We've identified 3 warning signs with Ford Motor (at least 1 which is potentially serious), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.

10 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy,24-Oct-23,It has been reported that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is offering a  20% raise over the next four years while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)  offered 23%.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-fastest-growing-auto-stocks-064059010.html,"In this article, we discuss the 10 fastest-growing auto stocks to buy. To skip the latest news and detailed analysis around the auto industry, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy.
Over the last few years, the automotive industry has gone through significant changes, such as the increasing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increased spending on autonomous vehicle research and deployment. However, these days, the latest strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) is the hottest topic in the auto industry. The union is targeting Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) and its primary demand is a 40% wage hike with a 20% immediate increase. According to Wells Fargo analysts, the increase in demanded salaries and wages would “add an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.”
The vice president of the union’s GM department said on October 20 that both parties are moving toward a tentative agreement that could possibly end the 5-week strike. It has been reported that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is offering a 20% raise over the next four years while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offered 23%. The companies are eager to put things back to normal. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)’s management said:
""It is time for us to finish this process, get our team members back to work and get on with the business of making GM the company that will win and provide great jobs in the U.S. for our people for decades to come.""
Even though UAW President, Shawn Fain, believes that there is “more to be won,” the union has not announced any further strikes yet. It is quite evident that these strikes are going to significantly affect the upcoming earnings reports of auto companies. However, Richard Hilgert, a Senior Equity Analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar’s research arm, says that the auto manufacturers can still evade massive losses if the strikes don’t prolong.
Latest in the Auto Industry
Although the electrification of vehicles and autonomous vehicle technologies aren’t that new, their demand and sales have certainly surged remarkably in the last few years. According to our previous report, the autonomous vehicle industry is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. Some major companies that have introduced self-driving cars include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Moreover, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), in a joint venture with GM’s subsidiary, Cruise, are planning to start a self-driving taxi service in Japan in 2026. 
Compared to autonomous vehicles, EV adoption has been notably faster and EV stocks have been some of the fastest-growing vehicles stocks in 2023. In 2022, the number of alternative energy vehicles sold crossed 10 million, showing a 54% year-over-year (YoY) increase. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that this number could reach 14 million.
The companies that are currently dominating the EV market include Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDY). Nevertheless, automotive giants such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) have also started to invest heavily in the sector. In fact, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) has already captured a noteworthy market share of the industry and is one of the top ten EV manufacturers in the world.
Despite the recent events that put a bearish light on the automotive industry, it still is poised for growth in the future. Analysts believe that the total vehicle sales will surpass 69 million units in 2023, and reach around 74 million in 2024. For the current year, some of the fastest-growing automotive stocks include Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD), Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI).

The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”

Oct 25 (Reuters) -
Production at a Ford Motor Company engine plant in Canada could halt by next Wednesday if there are no changes to a United Auto Workers strike in Kentucky, a Canadian union representative told Reuters.
The Ford Windsor Annex Engine Plant, with nearly 900 workers, makes engines mostly for Ford's Super Duty trucks at the plant in Louisville, Kentucky, John D'Agnolo, the union's auto council chair said on Wednesday.
Windsor is south of Detroit.
Ford is operating normally and monitoring the situation, the company said in a statement. ""In the event production is impacted, our Windsor team members will be the first to know.""
The UAW's strategy of targeted strikes has hit multiple U.S. plants and has throttled billions in revenue for the Detroit Three automakers. It also has rippled out, causing some auto parts makers and the plant in neighboring Canada to start feeling the heat.
""It's a waiting game,"" D'Agnolo said. ""I'm hoping the UAW can get an agreement that their members will be happy with.""

Yahoo  Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us  · Terms and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-stocks-q3-earnings-lineup-140500666.html,"The third-quarter earnings season for the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector began on Oct 18. So far, four S&P 500 sector components — Tesla, Genuine Parts, PACCAR and General Motors — have reported quarterly numbers. While Genuine Parts, PACCAR and General Motors managed to pull off an earnings beat, Tesla’s 10 consecutive quarter-long beat streak snapped as it reported lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of 2023.
Per the latest Earnings Trend report dated Oct 18, the auto sector’s earnings for the third quarter of 2023 are expected to decline 12.2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to rise 5.8% year over year.
Ford F, Harley-Davidson HOG, LKQ Corp LKQ, Oshkosh Corp OSK and Lear Corp LEA are some of the auto stocks lined up to report tomorrow. Before checking the key projections for these stocks, let's take a look at the general factors that are likely to shape the companies’ upcoming results.
Things to Note
Per Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year, thanks to improving retail inventories and strong fleet shipments. The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier, per GlobalData.
At the beginning of September, U.S. inventories had 2.2 million vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 813,000 cars and light trucks compared to September 2022, according to Cox Automotive. This marked a 60% increase from the year-ago levels and the highest new-vehicle inventory since early 2021.
The generous incentives offered by automakers are expected to have played a crucial role in boosting retail deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, offsetting the impact of high interest rates. However, discounts might have impacted margins. Also, commodity costs, forex woes, tough labor market and logistical challenges are likely to have played spoilsport. Moreover, high operating expenses, including R&D to develop technologically advanced products to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auto industry, are expected to have dented earnings.
Key Releases on Oct 26
Ford: This legacy automaker surpassed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected automotive revenues. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford topped earnings estimates on two occasions for as many misses, with the average surprise being 20.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford this earnings season. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +14.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at 40 cents per share. F is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.
Ford saw its U.S. sales increase 7.7% year over year to 500,504 units. Sales of hybrid vehicles, ICE and EVs in the United States came in at 34,861, 444,681 and 20,962 units, up 41.4%, 5.4% and 14.8%, respectively, on a yearly basis. Our estimate for global wholesale shipments of Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro segments is pegged at 750,000, 43,000 and 382,000 units, implying a year-over-year uptick of 1.2%, 73.8% and 19%, respectively.
Our forecast for third-quarter Ford Blue and Ford Pro adjusted EBIT implies an uptick of 6.2% and a whopping 370.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, we expect the Model e segment to incur an operating loss of $1.43 billion amid high costs.
Harley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle manufacturer missed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on lower-than-anticipated revenues from the Motorcycles & Related Products. HOG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, with the average surprise being 221.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Our model predicts an earnings beat for Harley-Davidson this time around as it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.68%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.39 a share. HOG will unveil results before market open.
Harley-Davidson is likely to have benefited from the Hardwire strategic plan, which aims at growth through refreshed product offerings. Our estimate for HOG’s revenues from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment — which constitutes the bulk of the firm’s overall revenues — is pegged at $1,362 million for the September-ended quarter, suggesting an increase from $1,205.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Our forecast for revenues from Financial Services is pegged at $202 million, suggesting a fall from $240 million generated in the second quarter of 2023.
We project operating profit from the HDMC segment to come in at around $220 million, suggesting an increase from $194.3 million generated in the last reported quarter. Our model estimate for operating profit from the HDFS segment is $60 million, compared with $59 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023.
LKQ: This automotive replacement parts provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter due to better-than-expected revenues from Wholesale North American and European segments. LKQ surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 1.53%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Our model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LKQ this time around, as it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 95 cents a share. LKQ will unveil results before market open.
In 2023, the average age of a new vehicle in the United States rose to 12.5 years, up from 12.2 years in 2022. Ageing vehicles are likely to have boosted demand for LKQ’s products. However, LKQ is witnessing supply chain disruptions, which might have resulted in product scarcity and freight delays. Problems related to freight costs and container capacity constraints are expected to have played spoilsport in the third quarter.
Our estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in Europe is pegged at $1,533.8 million, suggesting a rise from $1,376 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. We expect third-quarter revenues from parts and services in the North America unit to be $1,255 million, indicating a rise from $1,026 million recorded in the prior-year period. However, we expect quarterly revenues from parts and services in the Specialty segment to be $402.7 million, implying a decline from $452 million reported in the prior-year quarter.
Oshkosh: The automotive equipment provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on high operating margins in the Access and Vocational segments. OSK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average surprise being 27.45%. This is depicted in the graph below:

Our model predicts an earnings beat for OSK this earnings season, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.24%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.18 a share. Oshkosh will unveil results before the opening bell.
Strategic acquisitions like Pratt Miller, CartSeeker Technology, JBT's AeroTech business and Hinowa coupled with investment in Robotics are likely to boost the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Frequent business wins and a comprehensive offering of innovative new products are expected to aid Oshkosh’s upcoming results.
For third-quarter 2023, we estimate Access Equipment revenues — which form more than 50% of the total revenues — to be around $1,273.4 million, implying an uptick of 22.7% from the year-ago period. Our forecast for the segment’s operating profit is $182.3 million, suggesting growth of 48% on a yearly basis. Profits from Defense and Vocational segments are also estimated to rise year over year, thereby boosting OSK’s overall third-quarter earnings.
Lear: This manufacturer of automotive seating and electronic systems posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected revenues and profits across both segments. LEA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8.07%. This is depicted in the graph below:
Lear Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

Lear Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lear Corporation Quote
According to our model, it seems Lear is poised to maintain its beat streak this earnings season as well. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.63%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.56 a share. Lear will unveil results before the opening bell.
Lear is riding high on acquisitions, which are set to boost its upcoming results. The buyout of M&N Plastics has increased vertical integration in Lear’s E-Systems unit. The Kongsberg acquisition has strengthened Lear’s Seating business. The acquisition of Xevo has enhanced Lear’s capabilities in software, services and data analytics. The buyout of IGB has further expanded Lear’s product offerings in the growing thermal comfort solutions market.
Rising consumer demand for vehicle content— requiring signal, data and power management— and increasing electrification efforts by the company bode well for the results of the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for quarterly revenues from the Seating segment is pegged at $4,005 million, suggesting a rise of 3% from the prior-year quarter. We expect revenues from E Systems unit for the third quarter to be $1,371 million, indicating a rise from $1,353 million recorded in the prior-year period.

The deal, which needs approval by union leaders and members, would be the first settlement of strikes by 45,000 workers against Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-parent Stellantis that began Sept. 15.
""We told Ford to pony up and they did,"" Fain said in a video post on Facebook, adding that the strike at Ford ""has delivered.""

Fain said the UAW reached an historic agreement with Ford, including a 25% wage increase over the life of the contract. Ford workers will receive an immediate 11% wage hike. Including compounding and cost of living, worker pay will rise about 33% to over $40 an hour over the life of the contract.
In addition to the general wage hike, Fain said that the lowest paid temporary workers would see raises of more than 150% over the contract term and employees would reach top pay after three years. The union also won the right to strike Ford over future plant closures, he said.
Fain said UAW was asking Ford workers to return to work to put pressure on GM and Stellantis to reach a deal. Ford confirmed the news.
""We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the UAW covering our U.S. operations,"" Ford CEO and President Jim Farley said in a statement.
If the contract is ratified by Ford workers, it would set the standard for bargaining at General Motors and Stellantis and expire on April 30, 2028.
The Ford contract would reverse concessions the union agreed to in a series of contracts since 2007, when GM and the former Chrysler were skidding toward bankruptcy, and Ford was mortgaging its assets to stay afloat.
""This lays the groundwork for the next two contracts and they should fall in line fairly quickly because all three were within a narrow gap of each other,"" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
More than 45,000 union members working at the Detroit Three automakers have joined walkouts that began on Sept. 15.
""The strike so far has been painful for everybody and knowing what it takes to get a signed contract should bring them to the table much quicker,"" he said.
The UAW ratcheted up pressure on the companies by striking at each company's most profitable plant - GM's Arlington, Texas assembly plant, Ford's Kentucky heavy-duty pickup factory and Stellantis' Ram pickup plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.
Total economic losses from the auto workers' strike have reached $9.3 billon, the Anderson Economic Group said earlier this week.","{'negative': 0.914900175162724, 'neutral': 0.901496633887291, 'positive': 0.7749641603893704}",0.901496633887291,0.7749641603893704,0.914900175162724

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks wavered to a mixed close on Monday as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields backed down from 5% and investors shifted their focus to this week's high profile earnings and closely watched economic data.
The S&P 500 index ended modestly lower, while a host of interest rate sensitive momentum stocks buoyed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index to a higher close.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fourth straight daily drop.
""The story continues to be about interest rates, and to some extent switching from 'higher for longer' to 'how much higher for how much longer?'"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. ""The market has accepted the idea that the Fed is not going to lower rates any time soon.""
The tech-heavy Nasdaq racked up the largest gains among Wall Street's major indexes, while the blue-chip Dow was nominally lower.
The S&P 500 ended below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched technical level, for the second straight session.
The week ahead promises to be eventful for earnings, with reports by nearly one-third of the companies in the S&P 500.
These include megacap momentum drivers, including Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com, along with heavy-hitting industrials such as General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Boeing Co.
""With nearly a third of the S&P reporting this week, investors are hoping these 'magnificent seven' companies will end up surprising to the upside,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
So far, 86 of the companies in the S&P 500 have posted earnings. Of those, 78% have beat expectations, LSEG data showed.
Analysts see aggregate S&P 500 earnings for the July-September period growing 1.2% year-on-year, slightly below the 1.6% growth projected at the start of the month, according to LSEG.
The Commerce Department on Thursday will announce third-quarter gross domestic product, seen accelerating to 4.3%. Its wide-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, due on Friday, is expected to show annual headline and core inflation cooling down to 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively.
""The Fed wants to slow inflation at a quicker pace than it slows economic growth, and it's doing so,"" Pursche added. ""That's the classic definition of a soft landing.""
Geopolitical turmoil is also on the radar, with market participants looking for potential signs the Israel-Hamas conflict could broaden or escalate.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190.87 points, or 0.58%, to 32,936.41; the S&P 500 lost 7.12 points, or 0.17%, at 4,217.04; and the Nasdaq Composite added 34.52 points, or 0.27%, at 13,018.33.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, communication services notched the biggest gain, while energy shares suffered the largest percentage drop.
Walgreens Boots Alliance surged 3.3% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the pharmacy chain operator to ""overweight"" from ""neutral.""
Chevron fell 3.7% after the company said it would buy smaller rival Hess Corp in a $53 billion all-stock deal. Hess dipped 1.1%.
Agricultural sciences firm FMC tumbled 13.2% after the company lowered its third-quarter guidance.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 58 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 514 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.80 billion shares, compared with the 10.67 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ford Motor's current trading price of US$9.96 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
View our latest analysis for Ford Motor
What's The Opportunity In Ford Motor?
According to my valuation model, Ford Motor seems to be fairly priced at around 9.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ford Motor today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $11.02, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 16% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Ford Motor. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in F’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on F, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs (1 is a bit concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Ford Motor.

Ford Motor Company (F) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here ...,31-Oct-23,Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo Finance  Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us · Terms  and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-attracting-130011341.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -20.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has lost 21.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -47.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -27.8%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.5%. This estimate has changed -4.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.84 indicates a change of -8.6% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.8%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate of $37.64 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10%. The $158.67 billion and $159.45 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.5% and +0.5%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $41.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.74%. The EPS surprise was -2.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Ford shares inch higher pre-market following tentative UAW deal,30-Oct-23,Investing.com -- Shares in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) edged slightly  higher ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-shares-inch-higher-pre-074352170.html,"Investing.com -- Shares in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) edged slightly higher in premarket U.S. trading on Monday, after the carmaking giant reached a tentative labor deal with the United Auto Workers union that would end long-standing strikes at some of the company's plants.
On Sunday, the UAW outlined the major parts of the 4-1/2-year agreement, which includes $8.1 billion in investments in factory renovations and pay raises of at least 30% for many workers during the life of the contract. At the top-end range, some permanent employees would see an additional $70,000 in wages, while salaries for the lowest-paid temporary workers would jump by 150%.
A move by Ford to slash costs by offering lower pay to workers at component parts factories than those at vehicle assembly plants would also be erased.
In exchange for these concessions, Ford would retain the right to buyout the contracts of an unlimited number of older workers on top-rate wages for $50,000. The Michigan-based auto manufacturer could then replace them with younger employees who earn less than the top-end pay for three years.
UAW President described the deal, which still needs to be approved by the union's members, as a demonstration of the ""incredible power"" workers can have in labor negotiations. The protracted talks have been marked by the UAW exerting pressure on Ford -- as well as its peers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) -- through strikes at an expanding number of the firms' plants.
Chrysler-owner Stellantis and the UAW also reached a tentative agreement over the weekend. However, bargaining is ongoing between the union and GM, with Reuters reporting that discussions have hit a snag over retiree pension costs.

Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-add-more-tesla-ev-144455893.html,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor said on Monday it would add more of Tesla's Superchargers to its electric-vehicle charging network, higher than previously forecast, as automakers tap into the EV leader's sprawling charger network to expand the range of their cars.
Ford will now add over 15,000 of Tesla's Superchargers to its network, up from its earlier projection of 12,000 chargers.
The U.S. automaker said it would expand its BlueOval Charge Network in North America by 25% to over 106,000 chargers totally.
The addition of more chargers offers some relief to EV owners who have for years considered access to charging stations to be one of the main hurdles for purchasing a battery-powered vehicle.
Ford said customers can access three new charging providers: Francis Energy, Blink and Red E across the U.S. and Canada, with embedded charger routing and simple payment options via FordPass.
These three providers would bring more than 10,000 new chargers to the network, including more than 550 new DC fast chargers.
While details of pricing were not disclosed, the fast chargers, capable of adding hundreds of miles of driving range in an hour or less will be available to Ford EV customers via an adapter from next spring, the company said in the statement.
BlueOval combines multiple charging networks to provide access to the largest North American public charging network offered by automotive manufacturers. It includes providers such as Shell Recharge Solutions, Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint.
The development comes months after Ford struck a deal with Tesla to allow EV owners gain access to the biggest network of high-speed Superchargers in the United States in early 2024.
The tie-up between the rivals also made Ford the first major automaker to embrace Tesla's proprietary charging standard.

GEELONG, Australia, Nov. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbon Revolution plc, parent of Carbon Revolution Limited (the “Company” or “Carbon Revolution”), a Tier 1 OEM supplier and a leading global manufacturer of lightweight advanced technology carbon fiber wheels, announced that its stock will begin trading today on Nasdaq under the symbol “CREV” following the business combination of the Company with Twin Ridge Capital Acquisition Corp. (“Twin Ridge”) today.
Joining the board of Carbon Revolution plc after the business combination are four U.S.-based senior automotive executives including former General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz who has held executive positions at General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford Motor Company. Other appointees include: Burt Jordan, former Vice President of Global Purchasing Operations and Supply Chain Sustainability at Ford Motor Company; Jacqueline A. Dedo, co-founder of Aware Mobility LLC, and president at Piston Group, member of the board of directors of Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. and Workhorse Group Inc; and Matti Masanovich, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Catalent, former Global Vice President at Aptiv (formerly Delphi Automotive).

“We have come a long way over the last decade in developing and then further expanding the global footprint of our carbon fiber wheel technology, and we’re just getting started,” said Jake Dingle, CEO of Carbon Revolution plc. “We have been awarded 18 vehicle programs for six global OEMs including Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Renault, Ferrari N.V. and Jaguar Land Rover and intend to continue to expand our portfolio of global automaker clients as demand grows for disruptive efficiency technology, especially in the rapidly growing electric vehicle sector, which represents more than 50% of our backlog.”
“I would like to thank the entire Carbon Revolution team, as well as our partners at Twin Ridge, for their support and dedication throughout this process,” added Mr. Dingle. “I would also like to thank our new equity partner Orion Infrastructure Capital (‘OIC’), a leading infrastructure investment firm, and PIUS Limited, LLC, a Gallagher company specializing in IP-backed financing, for their confidence in our global business strategy.”
Capital available to the Company in connection with business combination is US$95 million, including US$35 million of the up to US$110 million Structured Equity Facility with two fund vehicles associated with OIC (OIC Structured Equity Fund I Range, LLC and OIC Structured Equity Fund I GPFA Range, LLC) and a US$60 million Committed Equity Facility, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions set forth therein. Release of the remaining US$75 million under the Structured Equity Facility is subject to the Company’s achievement of future growth milestones1.
“Today is a big day for Carbon Revolution as it begins to trade in the U.S. market,” said Bill Toler, Chairman of Twin Ridge. “We are thrilled to support the Company’s long-term vision as it experiences strong growth in global demand for its carbon fiber wheels. We are confident in the Company’s focus on further expanding its footprint in the rapidly growing market for EVs.”
Carbon Revolution wheels weigh up to 50% less than comparable aluminum wheels, and can provide an up to 5% to 10% increase to EV vehicle range.2 As the Company announced on August 31, it has been awarded a further 5 programs since August 2022 – including the first 2 for electric vehicles (EVs) – taking the total number of programs awarded to 183 with six global OEMs, including Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Renault, Ferrari N.V. and Jaguar Land Rover.
The Company’s backlog has more than doubled since October 2022 to US$730 million4, due primarily to new program awards, with almost 50% of backlog for EVs. Phase 1 of the Company’s first industrialized production line, known as the Mega-line, at its Australian production facility was commissioned this year and is progressing well with customer wheels in production and additional capacity expected to be added through to 2025. This is the first of what are expected to be multiple Mega-lines, including in strategically placed and lower cost offshore locations to enable lower costs and pricing in the coming years.
Carbon Revolution’s wheels significantly reduce unsprung mass, which greatly improves efficiency, while also helping leading global automakers to comply with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). These benefits have contributed to the award of 2 OEM EV wheel programs in recent months.
The Company initially penetrated the performance and premium end of the market with wheel programs for vehicles including Ford’s GT and Shelby Mustang GT350R and GT500, Ferrari’s 488 Pista, F8 Tributo, SF90 Stradale, 812 Competizione and 296 GTB, Renault’s Megane RS Trophy R, and GM’s Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and E-Ray. As the global automotive industry shifts to electric power and other sustainable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based engines. Carbon Revolution is well positioned to capture OEM demand for weight-saving efficiency technologies. Since the first sales on the Ford GT350R program in 2015 over 70,000 wheels have been sold across 11 programs to 5 OEMs. Carbon Revolution has strong operating momentum having had a record sales quarter from July to September, with 24% growth over the prior quarter.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-price-gains-dividend-analysts-164711746.html,"When the stock market gets rocky, dividends can provide a steady stream of income. And when those dividends come from companies with a bright future, that’s a win-win for investors.
After the stock prices have taken a beating this year, these three companies are sitting at, or near, all-time high dividend yields along with some major upside on price.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.
Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F)
Ford’s been in the spotlight recently, with Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas maintaining an Overweight rating on the automotive giant. Even better? He’s set a price target of $16, translating to a potential upside of approximately 53% from its current stance.
But here’s the kicker: on October 30, despite a rather lackluster third-quarter and a hovering cloud of uncertainty from a recent workers' union strike, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Ford's credit rating to Investment Grade.
Ford investors should be thrilled with its substantial 6.1% dividend yield – the highest it's been since the first quarter of 2020. This dividend, at $0.15 per share, will hit shareholder pockets on December 1, 2023.
Ford’s year hasn’t been all rainbows — the company’s shares have declined 11.5% year to date. They’ve also chosen to withhold the full year 2023 guidance, due to the pending ratification of its tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW).
Its earnings fell short of estimates for the third quarter. An EPS of $0.39 per share missed the mark of the estimated $0.45 and revenue of $41.18 billion fell just short of the estimated $41.22 billion.
Tegna Inc. (NYSE:TGNA)
Broadcasting giant Tegna isn’t without its accolades. Benchmark’s Daniel Kurnos, echoing positivity, reiterated a Buy rating and placed a price target of $22 — a potential increase of 55% from where it stands.
Earlier in the year, Tegna turned some heads by increasing its quarterly dividend to $0.1138 per share, making the yield now stand at 3.17%. The company's Q3 earnings report is slated for November 7, 2023.
Tegna's share price has taken a hit this year, dropping over 32% year to date. This puts the current dividend yield well above the 1% – 2% range that investors bought in at previously.
Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)
The skies are clearing up for Southwest Airlines. On the last day of October, Morgan Stanley's Ravi Shanker maintained an Overweight rating and stamped a price target of $47 — a whopping potential upside of 110%.
Rebounding from the pandemic’s clutches, Southwest reinstated its dividend in December after a near three-year hiatus. Its recent quarterly dividend? A comfortable $0.18 per share, boasting a yield of 3.2%. This yield makes the stock more attractive to income investors than 0.5% – 1.25% it paid out previously.
Q3 earnings were a mixed bag. Operating revenues touched $6.5 billion, a 4.9% year-over-year growth. However, EPS declined to $0.38 from last year's Q3 result of $0.50.
The flight path this year has been turbulent, with the airline’s shares dropping about 32%.
The Bigger Picture
For perspective, the broader S&P 500 offers a dividend yield of 1.62%. Moreover, it’s been a decent year for the index, with an uptick of approximately 8.8% year to date.
Remember, while the promise of high dividends and potential stock appreciation is tempting, always ensure your investments align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. And as ever, past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

Institutions' substantial holdings in Ford Motor implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price
43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock
If you want to know who really controls Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 58% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
After a year of 14% losses, last week’s 8.1% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ford Motor.
See our latest analysis for Ford Motor
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Ford Motor already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ford Motor's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Ford Motor. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.5%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.6% and 7.0% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Ford Motor Company. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$535m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
General Public Ownership
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ford Motor. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Ford Motor (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.

Ford urged govt to move fast on electric vehicle plan
By Tannur Anders
PRETORIA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The South African unit of U.S. auto giant Ford said on Wednesday it would invest 5.2 billion rand ($281 million) to produce a hybrid vehicle in the country, as it urged the government to move fast on an electric vehicle policy.
Three-quarters of cars produced by South Africa's auto industry, which accounts for 5% of gross domestic product and over 100,000 jobs, are exported, mostly to European countries.
But with the UK and Europe banning the sale of new petrol cars from 2035, South Africa's government has warned of an existential threat to the sector, and automakers have sought a government plan to transition to electric vehicles.
""The government really needs to finalise its policy and get it out there because other countries are moving fast, very fast,"" Andrea` Cavallaro, Ford's operations director of international market group, told Reuters.
In the meantime the company is focussed on producing hybrid vehicles - cars that can run on petrol like a regular internal combustion engine or ICE-driven vehicles and also run on electric charge.
Cavallaro was talking to Reuters on the sidelines of Ford celebrating 100 years of operations in South Africa and announcing an investment to produce the Ranger hybrid car.
The company said the investment would go into producing its Ranger Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle, which will be rolled out from its factory in Pretoria from late 2024.
""What we have seen is just this rapid escalation of the adoption of new energy vehicle technologies,"" President of Ford Motor Company in Africa Neale Hill told Reuters.
Ford plans to export about 70% of the 44,000 of the Ranger cars to Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Cavallaro said.

Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market
Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market
Dublin, Nov. 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Global In-vehicle Infotainment Market by Component (Display Unit, Control Panel, TCU, HUD), OS (Linux, QNX, MS), Service (Entertainment, Navigation, e-Call, Diagnostic), Connectivity, Form, Display Size, Location, Vehicle Type Region - Forecast to 2028"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering
The in-vehicle infotainment market is expected to experience significant growth, with its valuation projected to increase from USD 18.8 billion in 2023 to USD 31.4 billion by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9%
Several factors are contributing to this growth. First, there is an increasing demand for luxury vehicles equipped with advanced connectivity and safety features, offering consumers enhanced in-cabin experiences with various entertainment services at affordable costs.
Second, government regulations and mandates related to vehicle safety and connectivity are driving the adoption of in-vehicle infotainment systems. Lastly, the expansion of premium electric and hybrid vehicle ranges, particularly in China, Europe, and North America, is contributing to the development of the in-vehicle infotainment market.
North America is a dominant market in this industry, with the United States and Canada leading the way. Several factors contribute to the growth of the North American market. High demand for mid-size and large-size SUVs and pick-up trucks is a notable factor, as these vehicles often come equipped with advanced in-vehicle infotainment systems.
The region also enjoys a solid economic position, with higher disposable income levels, allowing consumers to invest in vehicles with advanced technologies. The presence of major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Tesla, along with infotainment system providers, contributes to market growth. Additionally, the region's robust telecom infrastructure enables connectivity and infotainment features in vehicles, enhancing the overall consumer experience.
Furthermore, the growth of the North American market is expected to be driven by stringent safety regulations. Authorities such as the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) have made features like automatic emergency braking (AEB) standard for vehicles.
This increased focus on safety features is expected to drive the demand for in-vehicle infotainment systems. Additionally, the adoption of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features is higher in North America, driven by the demand for premium electric vehicles (EVs) that come equipped with ADAS features. This trend is expected to continue, further boosting the demand for in-vehicle infotainment systems.
Leading players in the in-vehicle infotainment market include Harman International (US), Panasonic Corporation (Japan), Alps Alpine Co Ltd (Japan), Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), and Continental AG (Germany). These established companies are at the forefront of developing and providing advanced infotainment solutions for vehicles.
The display unit/infotainment unit segment is expected to lead the component segment
During the forecast period, the infotainment unit is expected to lead the in-vehicle infotainment market under the components segment. These front infotainment touchscreens provide a user-friendly interface, allowing drivers and passengers to easily access and control various vehicle functions and settings.
The convenience, interactivity, and intuitive navigation central touch screens offer significantly enhance the overall user experience. The display screen size of the infotainment varies based on vehicle class. For instance, entry-level car display unit ranges from 3-5"", whereas most mid-segment cars have an average screen size of 8-10"".
Nowadays new SUVs are incomplete without an all-encompassing infotainment system, the demand for SUVs is rising, hence rising the in-vehicle infotainment system market. SUVs offer some pretty impressive infotainment systems for instance, Lincoln Navigator has one of the most impressive infotainment systems is capable of wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration with a 13.2-inch touchscreen, has easy-to-read graphics and organizes apps and notifications perfectly.
The car sound system in the Lincoln SUV is a 14-speaker Revel stereo system which can be modified up to a 28-speaker Revel Ultima 3D system. Hyundai TUCSON comes with an 8.8-inch touchscreen with the option to make it a 10.3-inch display which is integrated into the dash. Therefore, the rapid advancement in in-car technology has resulted in manufacturers offering bigger and bigger infotainment screens which will create futuristic opportunities for the growth of the in-vehicle infotainment market in the upcoming years.
Thus, automotive OEMs are increasing the mass offering of infotainment systems irrespective of vehicle class along with rising integration of advanced features like navigation, media playback, weather update, route planning, smartphone connectivity, etc., which would continue to fuel the market demand for the infotainment system.
Passenger Cars are estimated to be the largest and fastest-growing segment for in-vehicle infotainment systems during the forecast period
The passenger car segment would lead and will also grow at the fastest pace for the in-vehicle infotainment system market. This is mainly due to the large share of passenger cars in total vehicle production in 2022, with more than 75%. Factors driving the demand for the in-vehicle infotainment system is the rising adoption of front infotainment units in lower-range cars, mainly in developing countries such as China and India.
OEMs have started offering features like small display screens, digital instrument clusters, and HUD even in some economy and mid-priced passenger cars to gain a competitive edge and attract customer attention. Additionally, growing luxury vehicle sales and demand for screens for rear passengers to offer a more personalized experience and comfort are factors expected to fuel the rear-row in-vehicle infotainment system market during the forecast period.
The emergence of 5G is also expected to contribute to developing the in-vehicle infotainment market. Hence the in-vehicle infotainment system market is expected to grow significantly.

Growing awareness of environmental issues, such as climate change and air pollution, and increased demand for cleaner and more fuel-efficient transportation options are expected to drive the hybrid cars market.
Wilmington, Delaware, United States, Nov. 10, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transparency Market Research Inc. -The global hybrid cars market is projected to flourish at a CAGR of 21.90% from 2023 to 2031. As per the report published by TMR, a valuation of US$ 2.1 trillion is anticipated for the market in 2031. As of 2023, the demand for hybrid cars is expected to close at US$ 447.94 billion.

UPDATE 1-Ford's Chicago plant UAW workers vote to ratify ...,08-Nov-23,Nov 8 (Reuters) - Workers at Ford Motor's Chicago assembly plant have voted  to ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fords-chicago-plant-uaw-110126400.html,"(Adds details from Facebook post in paragraph 2, background)
Nov 8 (Reuters) - Workers at Ford Motor's Chicago assembly plant have voted to ratify a proposed contract with the automaker, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union's local chapter said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.
UAW Local 551 said 57% of votes cast were in favor of the deal. Ford employs about 4,500 hourly workers at the assembly plant, which also manufacturers the Ford Explorer.
Union workers are voting on contracts from each of Chrysler-owner Stellantis, General Motors and Ford after the first coordinated strike against Detroit's Big Three automakers.
The ratification comes after the automakers and the UAW reached tentative deals over the last few weeks to end a costly strike following marathon negotiations.
The UAW's new agreement, which covers 57,000 workers overall at Ford, includes raises of 33% or more over the life of the contract, including cost-of-living adjustments that push up wages in line with inflation.
A majority of workers at Ford's Michigan assembly plant have already voted to approve the tentative deal.
Automakers had previously been slashing costs and navigating a bumpy road to manufacture EVs and catch up with market leader Tesla. However, lower margins on those vehicles have deterred them from accelerating the move.
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford in October withdrew its full-year results forecast due to ""uncertainty"" over the pending ratification of its deal with the UAW union, and warned of continued pressure on electric vehicles results.
The company has previously estimated that the new contract would add $850 to $900 in labor costs per vehicle.

Hilcorp Energy prints rare 10-year high-yield bond offering as ...,06-Nov-23,Hilcorp priced the first 10-year issue from a company with high-yield  issuer ratings since Ford Motor Co. ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners ·  Personal Finance...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hilcorp-energy-prints-rare-10-060000373.html,"As interest rates cascaded lower to kick off November, Hilcorp Energy on Nov. 3 announced and completed a $600 million intraday offering of 10-year (non-call five) senior unsecured notes, which it upsized from an initial pitch at $500 million, and which it priced at the tight end of talk (8.375%). Aside from its warm reception on the primary market, the issue stands out as just the second high-yield offering this year to sport a relatively long 10-year final maturity.
Hilcorp issued the longest dated deal this year among a relative profusion of prints from the oil & gas sector. Overall, it's the first 10-year deal with high-yield ratings since January. Synchrony Financial — which carries investment-grade issuer ratings (BBB-) — on Jan. 30 priced subordinated 7.25% 2033 bullet notes, rated BB+.
Hilcorp priced the first 10-year issue from a company with high-yield issuer ratings since Ford Motor Co. — now a rising-star issuer — priced 10-year green bullet notes last August. It’s the first deal to carry the 10-year (non-call five) structure since an offering from Builders FirstSource in June 2022.
The 10-year maturity was a mainstay for high-yield issuers as they reset their balance sheets after the Global Financial Crisis. There were 105-161 tranches of new-issue 10-year notes printed on the high-yield primary each year from 2010-2013, and 92-95 from 2014-2015. Since then, the highs were 91 in 2017 and 80 in 2021, versus low ebbs at 25 in 2018 and 12 last year.
Dovish signals from the Fed on Nov. 1, punctuated by a softer-than-expected jobs report on Nov. 3, triggered a dramatic change in the funding landscape from October to November. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 4.93% at the open on Nov. 1 to trades below 4.50% on Friday. (At the lows, yields were down more than half a point from 5.02% on Oct. 23, a high since the summer of 2007.) Against that move, new-issue 11.50% 2030 senior notes priced on Oct. 31 by Navient Corp. traded Friday at 104.75-104.875% of par, up above five percentage points from pricing (at an OID of 98.81), and versus early trades in the 100.125 area ahead of the Fed.
Ahead of last week's dramatic rate move, issuers steadily trimmed their borrowing horizons through the Fed's rate-tightening cycle, accelerating a much longer trend of shortening maturities. New-issue deals with maturities of five-years or less have accounted for a record 43% of all tranches priced on the US HY primary this year to Nov. 3, up from 28% in 2022 and 19% in 2021. The prior peak, at roughly 35% in 2020, came as issuers plied short-dated instruments to bridge the cash-flow disruptions triggered by the global pandemic. The average annual share for such short-dated issuance was much lower from 2010-2019, at 20%, LCD data show.
As borrowers recoiled from high long-term debt service costs, the maturity profile for the pool of outstanding bonds was the shortest on record as the Fed deliberated last week. The average years to maturity for constituents of the S&P US High Yield Corporate Bond Index touched an all-time low at 5.75 years on Oct. 31, down from 6.3 years at the end of 2022, and seven years just ahead of the declaration of the global pandemic in March 2020. That average was at eight years just ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

From a production standpoint, Rivian boosted its full-year forecast to 54,000 from 52,000 units. Its prior forecast of 52,000 units was lifted earlier in the year from 50,000.
""Due to the progress experienced on our production lines, the ramp of our in-house motor line, and the supply chain outlook, we are increasing our 2023 production guidance to 54,000 total units,"" the company said in its Q3 shareholder letter.
Rivian also narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA loss to $4.0 billion from $4.2 billion and revealed that its 2023 capex (capital expenditure) guidance was reduced to $1.1 billion.

Finally, Rivian said it is no longer subject to exclusively selling its electric delivery van (EDV) to Amazon, which is a shareholder in Rivian. Rivian still plans to build 100,000 delivery vans for Amazon, per an earlier agreement.
Amazon waiving off the exclusivity clause creates “a key upside potential to unlock EDV/Vans from being only 20-35k deliveries/yr towards its 60k+ capacity,” Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally said in a note to investors. Rivian said its EDVs have higher margins than its consumer-focused R1 vehicles.
For the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.34 billion vs. $1.31 billion estimated, with an adjusted loss per share of $1.19 vs. $1.32 expected. That revenue figure represents a 19.6% jump from Q2’s $1.12 billion and 150% more than the $536 million reported a year ago. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, Rivian reported a loss of $942 million vs. $1.04 billion expected, which is also narrower than the $1.3 billion loss reported a year ago.
""We're going to focus on driving up production volume and achieving better fixed cost leverage, achieving meaningful reductions in our material costs from a bill of materials point of view, working on building out our commercial and go-to-market operations to allow us to, not only continue driving demand, but to continue driving up our ASPs [average selling price],"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the Q3 conference call.
Last month, Rivian reported deliveries of 15,564 EV trucks, more than the 14,973 estimated per Bloomberg. Production also topped estimates at 16,304 vehicles.

Shares of EV makers and legacy automakers like GM (GM) and Ford (F) have also been hit hard, with the companies reporting waning or “evolving” EV demand. Last month Ford paused $12 billion worth of investments in its EV projects until “capacity” is needed. Ford said in its earnings report that US EV buyers were “unwilling to pay premiums for [EVs] over gas or hybrid vehicles, sharply compressing EV prices and profitability.” Fellow Big Three automaker GM pushed back its EV truck expansion in late October, noting “evolving EV demand” as the main reason for slowing its EV truck volumes.
Even Tesla (TSLA) isn’t immune to the EV demand story, with the automaker delaying construction of its upcoming Gigafactory in Mexico due to concerns about global economic conditions stemming from rising interest rates.
That being said, Rivian and its lifestyle-oriented trucks might be an outlier in the EV landscape.
Rivian’s aforementioned Q3 deliveries were up 23% sequentially compared to Q2, even as the company raised prices after selling out its initial cheaper orders. Unlike Ford and GM, Rivian is targeting coastal and higher-income buyers who are more immune to rising prices and higher interest rates compared to the broader population.
Rivian's path to profitability is by no means assured, however. Rivian’s valuation balances the company’s “recently strong execution against a challenging 2+ year execution plan,” Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note, adding that there is “a non-zero risk of delays and cost overruns.”

Made from sustainably sourced bamboo fiber
Three-ply composition for premium-level strength and softness
Plastic-free packaging
Modern, contemporary design
Septic-safe
Lint- and dust-free
BPA free
No inks or dyes
Since its founding, gross revenue has nearly doubled with the company projecting $18 million in 2023. With the brand sold in Target stores — along with other retail outlets — there's plenty of room for growth.
Reel Paper secured $1.14 million from 727 investors at a valuation cap of $55 million.

Partnerships with industry heavyweights like MIH-Foxconn and academic collaborations with Stanford and Columbia University further enhance its innovative edge.
Test drives in Brooklyn, New York, mark the beginning of Olympian Motors' ascent, with a full commercial launch in New York and California targeted for late 2023. Looking ahead, the company aims to capture a 7% share of the U.S. passenger-vehicle market by 2030, challenging incumbents like Ford and Rivian Automotive Inc.

Here is What to Know Beyond Why Ford Motor Company (F) is ...,13-Nov-23,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Ford Motor Company (F) is a Trending Stock  ... Yahoo Finance. Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and  reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-ford-motor-140011375.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -16.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has lost 17.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share, indicating a change of -64.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -52.7% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.94 points to a change of +3.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -7.3%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.81 indicates a change of -6.8% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

UAW members at Ford GM plants in Kentucky and Michigan ...,13-Nov-23,Yahoo. Advertisement. Yahoo Finance. UAW members at Ford GM ... UAW  members picket General Motors at the company's engine plant in Spring Hill  Tenn. Oct.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-members-at-ford-gm-plants-in-kentucky-and-michigan-reject-tentative-deal-194714967.html,"Ford (F) and GM (GM) both suffered slight hiccups with UAW member votes on tentative contracts, but the automakers and the union are still cautiously optimistic the ratifications will happen.
The UAW revealed members at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant and Louisville Assembly Plant, where Ford’s Super Duty trucks and full-size SUVs are assembled, voted down the tentative agreement by 54.5% and 50.4% ""no"" votes, respectively. However, skilled workers at both those plants overwhelmingly approved of the deal (65.8% and 76.7% respectively).
Of the plants that have voted, Ford’s Kentucky Truck and Louisville Assembly were the first UAW chapters to vote against the deal, adding some uncertainty to the ratification process. That being said, 27 other chapters have voted to approve the deal, with several chapters still outstanding.
On the GM side, the UAW posted on Facebook that Local 598, which represents GM’s Flint Truck assembly plant, voted 51.8% against the tentative deal. The Flint Assembly plant employs 4,746 UAW workers and assembles trucks including the Chevrolet Silverado HD pickup.
UAW members picket General Motors at the company's engine plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., Oct. 30, 2023. (Seth Herald/REUTERS/TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) (Seth Herald / reuters)
""The situation at GM is more serious as a potential threat to ratification at that company than at Ford, though I would not take anything for granted,"" labor expert Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University's Mike Ilitch School of Business, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the contract is rejected at one company, the union will have several decisions to make, including whether to call out a strike, how to deal with maintaining pattern agreements, and determining what they should try to get to satisfy rank and file.""
GM shares dipped on Friday following news of the vote. However, per the UAW’s GM vote tracker, 58% of UAW members working at GM plants have approved the the tentative deal thus far.
On the Ford side, the numbers are even stronger: 65.3% of Ford UAW workers have approved the tentative deal, versus 34.7% who have not. Again, not all the plants on both the Ford and GM side have voted.
A tentative contract is ratified if a majority of hourly workers (which includes production and skilled trades) who vote vote in favor of the agreement. There is no possibility of a plant-level strike or negotiation, a source told Yahoo Finance.
While the potential of new labor contracts has investors concerned the Big Three automakers will have a cost disadvantage versus other non-union automakers, this may not be the case. The effects of the UAW’s collective bargaining efforts are now trickling down to other non-union automakers, who are concerned workers may perceive they are not getting paid enough — and may jump ship.
Today, Hyundai announced “a wage strategy” starting in January 2024 that will give its Georgia assembly workers wage increases of 25% by 2028. This follows Honda’s announcement on Friday that it will implement 11% wage increases for its US factory workers, and Toyota’s move a couple weeks back to hike wage by 9% for its hourly and skilled workers.

Chicago, IL – November 16, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA.
Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:
UAW & ""Detroit 3"" Tentative Deal Leads to Mixed Responses
After extensive negotiations and a seven-week strike, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union reached tentative agreements with Detroit 3 automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. But despite achieving record contracts with the auto biggies, not all UAW members are satisfied. As of the latest updates, the agreements are being voted on by union members, with varying levels of support across different automakers.
While GM and F carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, STLA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
At three key GM assembly plants, representing 21% of the company's 46,000 employees covered by the UAW, the proposed contract has faced rejection. Specifically, 61% of the workforce at the Lansing Delta Township plant in Michigan, responsible for producing Buick and Chevrolet crossovers, voted against the agreement. In Spring Hill, TN, a plant manufacturing Cadillac and GMC crossovers saw even higher opposition, with 67.5% rejecting the deal. Additionally, GM's Flint, MI, truck plant reported 52% against the agreement. A few smaller GM facilities also recorded votes against the pact.
Ford has seen a similar trend, with more than 54% of members at its Kentucky Truck Plant voting against the agreement. Stellantis, on the other hand, is witnessing stronger support, with approximately 82% of members favoring the contract so far.
The discontent among the union members, especially at General Motors and Ford, stems from various factors. Long-serving employees fear they might not benefit as much as newer ones, especially regarding retirement benefits. There's also skepticism about the contract language and distrust due to past corruption scandals involving former union leaders. Additionally, inflated expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain regarding significant wage increases and the elimination of employment ""tiers"" have raised dissatisfaction.
The UAW's tentative agreements have indeed made notable progress, including a 25% wage increase, faster progression to top wages (from eight to three years) and significant new investments, including for battery workers. However, the agreements have fallen short in several areas, such as delivering a 40% general wage increase, which the UAW had called for, and eliminating wage and benefit tiers. The agreements also failed to reduce the workweek to 32 hours and lacked comprehensive post-retirement health care and traditional pensions for all employees.
Nonetheless, the UAW has touted these deals as a substantial advancement from previous negotiations, emphasizing gains for veteran workers and steps toward achieving equal pay for equal work. Quoting Fain, “I truly believe these are record contracts and are a major victory for our movement.”
Having said that, voices from within the UAW, like Brian Keller and Timothy Orner, express concerns about various aspects of the agreements, including parts consolidation, potential layoffs, and changes in 401(k) benefits. These concerns highlight the nuanced perspectives within the union, reflecting a diversity of priorities and expectations.
The mixed reception of these agreements reflects trust issues, expectation management, and the complexities of balancing diverse worker needs. What happens next depends on the union members' votes. If they reject a company's agreement, the UAW might have to change its approach, possibly revisiting negotiations or calling more strikes.
These outcomes will not only shape the UAW's future but could also influence labor practices across the industry. Following the tentative deals, automakers like Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai have raised wages, showing the UAW's wider impact on the sector. As the industry awaits the final voting results, the potential ripple effects of these agreements are a point of focus.

Here's Why You Should Retain Honda Motor (HMC) Stock Now,1 month ago,For instance the company's joint venture with GAC Group and Dongfeng Motor  Group will drive its EV prospects in China. ... Yahoo Finance Plus ·  Screeners...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-honda-motor-163000360.html,"Honda HMC is a leading manufacturer of automobiles and the largest producer of motorcycles in the world. The automaker is poised to benefit from its expanding lineup of electric vehicles, frequent collaborations to expand the business and cost-containment efforts. However, high R&D expenses on advanced technologies and alternative fuels remain a concern.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Honda’s 2024 earnings per share is pegged at $3.91, implying a rise of 29% from the year-ago reported number.

Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.
Growth Indicators
Honda’s 2030 Vision, which emphasizes electrified mobility products, bodes well. Its sharp focus on providing attractive products with an expanding lineup of electric vehicles (“EVs”) in light of changing circumstances in the automobile industry is likely to boost prospects. Japan’s auto giant targets EVs to account for 20% of sales in Japan and 40% of sales in North America and China by the decade’s end. Honda plans to launch Acura ZDX and Honda Prologue in North America by early 2024. It also plans to introduce 10 models in the next five years underits e:N series.

Honda has been frequently collaborating to expand its business. For instance, the company’s joint venture with GAC Group and Dongfeng Motor Group will drive its EV prospects in China. Partnership with CATL, collaboration with BMW and Ford to establish ChargeScape, alliance with SCSK Corp and recent memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Mitsubishi bode well.
Honda’s partnership with General Motors to develop affordable EVs will further drive growth. Its plan to launch more than 10 electric motorcycle models globally by 2025 and 3.5 million units by 2030 is praiseworthy. In August, Honda launched its first personal-use electric motorcycle in Japan, EM1 e. Demonstrating innovation, Honda showcased the SC e: Concept motorcycle at the Japan Mobility Show 2023.

As part of the global restructuring move, Honda has been taking steps to control costs and optimize production capacity. Honda will be able to lower fixed costs and vehicle production expenses, thereby generating savings that can be directed toward more profitable opportunities and rev up profits. Cost-containment efforts are boosting the firm's financials. Honda has a manageable total debt-to-capital ratio of 0.29.

Upbeat projections for fiscal 2024 spark optimism. Honda projects sales volumes from Motorcycle and Automobile segments to be 18.8 million units and 4.10 million units, respectively, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 levels of 18.75 million units and 3.68 million units, respectively. For fiscal 2024, Honda forecasts revenues of ¥20 trillion, indicating an uptick of 18.3% year over year. Operating profit is envisioned at ¥1.2 trillion, implying growth of 53.7% year over year. Pretax profit is forecast at ¥.39 trillion, suggesting an increase of 58.6% year over year.
Concerns
High R&D expenses on advanced technologies and alternative fuels for the development of electric and autonomous vehicles bode well for the future. However, the same is also likely to limit the near-term margins and cash flows of the company. Although Honda’s fiscal 2024 sales volume forecast for the Motorcycle and Automotive segments indicates an uptick year over year, the company has trimmed projections for the Automotive unit due to the challenging environment in China.

Hyundai Kia see strong demand for EVs despite rivals ...,1 month ago,Other major EV makers from Tesla to Ford Motor have pushed back EV-related  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyundai-kia-see-strong-demand-195304910.html,"By Abhirup Roy
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor and Kia see strong U.S. demand for electric vehicles (EVs), senior executives at the South Korean automakers told Reuters ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show.
The comments run against industry fears that inflation and higher interest rates will undermine the boom in EV sales. Other major EV makers from Tesla to Ford Motor have pushed back EV-related factory buildouts in the face of economy-related concern.
""I am still very bullish on the battery electrics,"" Jose Munoz, Hyundai's global chief operating officer, said in Los Angeles ahead of the auto show that opened on Friday, adding the company's EV sales were doubling year-over-year.
""Our investments in the battery electric plant in Savannah (Georgia) move on. So we're pushing as much as we possibly can to get it ready by October next year,"" he said. ""(Investments) are not on track. They are accelerated. We are pulling ahead.""
Munoz added that, ""based on what I see, I need more. If I had more capacity today, I could sell more cars.""
Kia, which is 34% owned by Hyundai, has a similar view as its sister company.
Press day at the Los Angeles Auto Show
""We're still growing organically despite the weather outside,"" said Steven Center, chief operating officer at Kia America, referring to the economic climate. ""We're not seeing a slowdown.""
He added that Kia was expanding into additional segments that would power EV growth. ""All things being equal, as they say in economics, we'll continue to grow in volume, and the EV side will do most of the growing.""
Inflation and high interest rates have raised the costs of buying a car. Electric-vehicle makers meanwhile are dealing with supply-chain bottlenecks and pricing pressure from Tesla, which led EV price cuts this year.
The average price paid for a new EV in the United States fell to just over $50,000 in September from more than $60,000 in January, according to Cox Automotive.
The cuts helped drive EV sales in the third quarter up 50% from a year earlier to a record of more than 300,000 vehicles.
Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk last month flagged his concerns about expanding factory capacity until interest rates ease, echoing similar signs of caution from General Motors and Ford.
Startups Lucid and Fisker cut their 2023 production targets this month and Swedish EV maker Polestar trimmed its delivery forecast and halved its margin guidance for the year.
About one in four Americans in the market for a new car intend to buy an EV, according to consumer insights firm the Langston Co. That is not enough, said Spencer Imel, a partner at Langston.
""As early adopters have converted there is a lack of newly interested consumers to keep demand for the EV category high,"" he said.
To be sure, many in the industry are still trying to understand EV trends. Japanese automaker Subaru's chief executive, Atsushi Osaki, told Reuters he was not sure about demand in the short term but was committed to the EV market.
""There might be a bit of stagnation due to inflation at the moment, but as we look at it over a long span to 2030, we believe that we'll have the ability to have battery EVs make up for about half of our sales,"" he said. ""However, as it's the market that decides in the end, we'll adapt flexibly to that.""

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-reports-strong-q3-120000758.html,"Dive Brief:
The Trade Desk reported a 25% year-over-year revenue increase to $493 million in Q3, per an earnings statement. For the first three quarters of the year, total revenue hit $1.34 billion, up 23% YoY.
The Trade Desk called out growing support for Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), its attempt to create an alternative to third-party cookies. The solution has been adopted by publishers including Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Walmart Connect, the big-box store’s retail media network.
Despite the strong earnings, shares dropped around 30% after the company announced that Q4 revenues would be lower than analyst estimates. Executives said the lower guidance was based on advertiser cautiousness as a result of strikes in the auto and entertainment industries.
Dive Insight:
The Trade Desk’s Q3 earnings suggest that the demand-side platform has benefitted from advertisers kickstarting more digital spending. Co-founder and CEO Jeff Green said that the performance speaks to the premium brands have put on “precision, agility and transparency” in their campaigns.
“As we enter our busiest time of year and look ahead to 2024, we have never been in a better position to capture a greater share of the $1 trillion advertising total addressable market,” Green said in an earnings release. “With the generational shift to [connected TV], the growing opportunity in shopper marketing, our leadership in identity, and our most important product release ever with Kokai, we are better positioned than ever to help advertisers leverage data to drive growth and differentiate their brands.”
In UID2, The Trade Desk hopes to have a viable option for a post-cookie world. The earnings release highlighted the solution’s adoption across a growing number of CTV and streaming services, which has led to improved ad targeting and more efficient spending. The Trade Desk added that Walmart Connect has begun testing the integration of UID2 across its retail media network, opening up a new channel of opportunity for the programmatic company.
However, The Trade Desk’s guidance projected Q4 revenue of around $580 million,  about $30 million less than analyst estimates. The patchy outlook led the company’s stock to plunge about 30% in after-hours trading. In its earnings call, Green said the lower guidance was the result of spending reductions due to the strikes in entertainment and media and the automotive sector.
“We saw some reduction in brand spend in verticals such as automotive and consumer electronics, for instance, specifically around cell phones and media and entertainment,” Green said during the call. “Some of these industries have been recently impacted by strikes, such as the U.S. auto industry.”
The United Auto Workers union launched strikes against General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Stellantis in September, and the SAG/AFTRA unions had been striking against the major Hollywood studios since the summer. Those strikes have since been resolved.

Tesla: Breaking Down Ron Baron's Bull Thesis
Who Is Ron Baron?
Ron Baron is a legendary American Investor and founder of Baron Capital Group, a prominent investment management firm. Born in 1943, Baron is known for his long-term investment approach and has achieved success by identifying and investing in companies with significant growth potential.
Baron Capital manages various mutual funds, focusing on diverse sectors such as technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. Wall Street recognizes Baron for his optimistic outlook on the stock market and his unique ability to have conviction in his long-term ideas. In other words, Baron tends to both be right and sit tight.
Among Baron's most recent investment triumphs is his oversized Tesla investment. Perhaps no one else outside of Elon Musk has a better grip on the leading EV-maker than Baron. Baron invested more than a half billion dollars in TSLA between 2014 and 2016 and has held it ever since. Baron Capital's TSLA position has generated more than $5 billion in profits and catapulted the firm to being the only mutual fund to beat the Nasdaq Composite over the past 5, 10, and 15 years. Unsurprisingly, Baron remains as bullish as ever on the stock. Here are 3 reasons why:
Low Cost, Mass-Market Vehicle
An integral bear argument against owning Tesla shares is that the company is hyper-focused on only the luxury market. Though the strategy has worked thus far for Tesla and other luxury companies such as Ferrari, Tesla bears believe that it limits the total addressable market (TAM) for the leading EV-maker and puts a ceiling on growth. However, a recent Reuters report suggests that the days of only focusing on luxury clients are coming to an end.
Reuters reported that Elon Musk plans to build a mass-market vehicle in its new gigafactory that will retail for less than $30,000 USD. Ron Baron believes that the ""Model 2"" $25k EV will begin selling within a year and a half. A new, mass-market EV would likely drive Tesla's already ""hockey stick""-like revenue trajectory even higher.
Juicy Profit Margins Lead to Enormous Profits
In a recent CNBC interview, Baron said, ""Ford (F) loses $36k per EV produced while Tesla makes between $8-9,000 per car. Tesla plants make about $15 billion per year on a $7 billion investment. An ordinary industrial company would make 15-20% on capital at the most – this guy (Elon) is making back his capital twice a year.""
The fact is that no other EV-maker has profit margins that are remotely close to Tesla.
The FSD Leader
The race for self-driving vehicles is well under way and is competitive. Alphabet's Waymo and Mobileye are among the front runners in the space. However, Baron points out that Tesla collects 100 million miles worth of data a day and has more compute to train its FSD than any other company.

Investors Heavily Search Ford Motor Company (F): Here is ...,1 month ago,Yahoo! Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos · Yahoo Finance  Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors · Contact Us · Terms  and...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-ford-motor-140010383.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -9.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share, indicating a change of -72.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -55.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.91 points to a change of +1.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.5%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.78 indicates a change of -7% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.8%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ford Motor Company.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate of $36.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.4%. The $162.92 billion and $163.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.3% and +0.5%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $41.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.74%. The EPS surprise was -2.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Ford to resume building Michigan electric vehicle battery plant ...,1 month ago,DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is resuming construction on a Michigan ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us · Terms...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-resume-building-michigan-electric-153727352.html,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is resuming construction on a Michigan electric vehicle battery plant that the company postponed two months ago during a strike by the United Auto Workers union.
But the automaker said that due to slowing electric vehicle sales growth, it will scale back the factory's size, cutting the number of planned jobs by about one third to 1,700 from 2,500. The annual battery cell output will drop from enough for 400,000 vehicles per year to about 230,000.
Ford put the plant, originally to cost $3.5 billion, on hold in late September as the union went on strike at targeted assembly plants run by Ford, General Motors and Jeep maker Stellantis. The contract dispute ended last week with workers at all three voting to ratify new agreements.
Spokesman Mark Truby said Tuesday that the company looked at growth forecasts for electric vehicle sales, its EV product plans and whether it could make a sustainable business out of the factory in Marshall, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Detroit.
“We are now good to confirm that we are moving forward with the plant,” he told reporters.
The plant will open in 2026 on the same timeline as the company set when it announced the factory in February. It will produce batteries with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is cheaper than the current nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry now used in many EV batteries. Consumers will be able to choose between a battery with lower range and cost, or pay more for higher range and power.
Unlike the company's other battery plants that are joint ventures, the Marshall factory will be a fully owned Ford subsidiary staffed by Ford workers. But China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, which is known for its lithium-iron-phosphate expertise, would supply technology, some equipment and workers.
Truby said he wasn’t sure how much the company would spend on the scaled back plant.
U.S. electric vehicle sales are still growing at a high rate, but not as fast as they were last year, causing many automakers to slow their battery and assembly plant building plans.
In June of last year, for instance, electric vehicle sales were growing about 90% year over year, according to Motorintelligence.com. But by June of this year, the growth rate had slowed to about 50%, and automakers are fearful it will slow even further with consumers having reservations about how far they can travel and whether charging stations will be available.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told reporters after a bill signing Tuesday that the incentive package promised to Ford would be reduced, saying that “when one aspect is resized, so is the other.” Specifics on the new package would come from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which handles the state’s incentive fund for economic developments, she said.
The state has allocated nearly $1.7 billion in incentives for the project, and added $65 million in October for site readiness.
When it announced third-quarter earnings in October, Ford said a slowdown in electric vehicle sales and prices has led to a delay in plans to build one of two new joint-venture EV battery factories in Kentucky that was announced two years ago. The company also is trimming Mustang Mach-e production and delaying other spending on EVs totaling $12 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said.
Truby said scaling back the Michigan plant was part of the $12 billion. He said the company is still bullish on EVs. “While there is growth both in the U.S. and worldwide, clearly the growth isn’t at the rate that we and others had expected,” he said.
Sales of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, its top-selling electric vehicle, have struggled this year. They're up only 1.5% through October and were down 7% last month. Sales of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup are up 42.7% for the year. Shares of Ford fell just over 1.4% Tuesday in a largely down day in the markets for automakers.","{'negative': 0.9313653409481049, 'neutral': 0.8677922657557896, 'positive': 0.8160949604851859}",0.8677922657557896,0.8160949604851859,0.9313653409481049

Tesla TSLA increases Model Y price in China
Electric vehicle (EV) giant, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced Tuesday that it has increased the price of its Model Y Long Range Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD) in China, indicating a healthy appetite for the all-electric crossover.
According to Tesla China's announcement on local social media platforms, the Model Y Long Range now carries an increased price tag of RMB 304,400 ($42,741), up by RMB 2,000 yuan ($280) from its previous price.
Previously listed at RMB 302,400 ($42,460), the recent increase translates to a modest 0.66% rise in the Model Y Long Range's price. This latest adjustment is the fourth within a month by Tesla China.
In late October, Tesla raised the price of its Model Y Performance by RMB 14,000 ($1,965). The adjustment was followed by additional adjustments to the company’s Model 3 Long Range and Model Y Long Range on November 9th. Tesla followed those adjustments by raising the price of its Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive and Model Y Rear Wheel Drive on November 14th.
However, unlike past changes silently made on the official order pages, these adjustments were notably pre-announced.
Some industry observers believe this strategy aims to stimulate immediate purchases, leveraging media communication to encourage swift customer action amidst Tesla's evolving pricing structure.
Shares of TSLA ended the week up 0.569% on Friday.

Ford resumes factory construction
Also announced Tuesday, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will resume construction of their factory near Marshall, Michigan, after being paused for two months.
Ford will own the factory, and has agreed to give the United Auto Workers the opportunity to organize the plant's workers without a vote.
The U.S. automaker plans to use the facility to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries starting in 2026. The batteries will be produced using technology based on a licensing agreement with CATL.
The company's ties with CATL has drawn negative attention from U.S. lawmakers. Some government officials are opposed to the idea of American subsidies benefitting a Chinese entity such as CATL.
Representative Mike Gallagher, a Republican who chairs House committee on China, spoke on Tuesday, expressing his disappointment in Ford's reported decision.
""The American people deserve better from an iconic U.S. company that receives massive taxpayer subsidies. Ford needs to call off this unethical deal for good,"" Gallagher said.
The Detroit automaker also announced that the company is scaling back its plans for the Blue Oval Battery Park in Michigan. They were going to spend $3.5 billion to make batteries and hire 2,500 people.
Ford now plans to cut the Michigan battery plant's capacity to 20 gigawatt hours and reduce hiring to 1,700.
Ford spokesman, Mark Truby said that Ford will also scale back its capital investment. However, Truby did not give an exact figure on the capital reduction, he indicated the total investment will be proportional to the 40% reduction in capacity. A proportional reduction would lead to a new investment price of around $2 bilion.
Shares of F ended the week up 1.057% on Friday.
VW boosts pay following UAW gains
German automaker, Volkswagen AG VZO O.N. (ETR:VOWG_p) announced Wednesday that the car company is implementing a pay bump for their production workers at the Chattanooga plant in Tennessee by 11%.
Volkswagen and other car companies in the U.S. that aren't part of a union are feeling pressured to improve pay and benefits after the United Autoworkers (UAW) secured some major concessions in their newest labor contract following a six-week strike against the Detroit Three.
Honda Motor Co Ltd ADR (NYSE:HMC) and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), both non-union companies, have also increased wages for their factory workers in the U.S. The moves coincide with signs that the union might be eyeing foreign-owned auto plants, like Tesla's, for potential unionizing efforts.
Hyundai Motor Co DRC (OTC:HYMTF) has also declared plans to raise wages by 25% over the next four years for their non-union workers in Alabama and Georgia.
Volkswagen's pay hike kicks in from December, and they're rolling out a quicker wage progression starting in February.

We are at the end of 2023, and recession hasn’t hit the world’s biggest economies like the US and China, as predicted by several analysts earlier. In March, over 70% of the National Association of Business Economics’ (NABE) survey panelists believed that the growth in the consumer price index (CPI) would remain above 4% by the end of the year. Furthermore, 24% of the panelists believed a recession might start in the third quarter of 2023.
In the October 31-November 1 meeting, the Federal Reserve did not raise the interest rates for the third time in the last four sessions as the CPI dropped to 3.7% in September and was at 3.2% in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The employment rate has remained steady with slight fluctuations, and the stock market has shown resilience as the S&P 500 is up 19.23% and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.13% year-to-date on November 24. Additionally, the US GDP grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023, up from 2.1% in the second quarter.
Nonetheless, experts still have different opinions about the economic outlook. While some experts believe that the US will be able to achieve a “soft landing,” others believe that risks of recession are still there.
Investment Strategies During Rough Economic Conditions
While experts can sometimes correctly predict market conditions and provide close to accurate forecasts, the market remains unpredictable for several reasons. For example, no one could have predicted the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which sent the global economy into chaos. Furthermore, many financial news websites suggest investing in utilities, healthcare, and real estate segments during tough economic conditions. However, our previous report suggests that these three were this year's worst performing sectors of the stock market.
Despite the unpredictability of the market, there are still some steps that can be taken to avoid losing a lot of money during an economic turmoil. Value stocks are a good option during a recession as it is believed that even though value stocks are not an absolute protection against recession, they are likely to do less damage to your investment portfolio during one. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid companies with unsustainable debt and high volatility.
Another option investors, especially beginners, can opt for is safe, well-established stocks that aren’t affected by short-term economic fluctuations and can safeguard investments for the long term till the economy shows clear signs of recovery.
Some examples of safe stocks can be The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Both of the companies are old, well-established in their sectors, and have a stable dividend and sustainable payout ratios.
Hedge funds are also a great option because leaving it to the experts might be the best option when there is high uncertainty and a lack of knowledge. Some of the most successful hedge fund managers include Warren Buffett, Ken Griffin, and Seth Klarman. Klarman’s Baupost Group has been able to post average annualized returns of 20% since its inception. On the other hand, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investments posted $16 billion in profits in 2022.
While economists and experts are still debating the direction that the economy might take, stocks with low valuations, which are favored by hedge funds, can prove to be beneficial for investors. While the PE ratio is not the absolute metric for defining a cheap stock, it can definitely help an investor determine a stock's relative valuation. Some cheap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).

Best Very Cheap Stocks To Buy Now According To Hedge Funds
12. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)

The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) is one of the best very cheap stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, along with America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)
The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) was mentioned in ClearBridge Investments’ second quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:
“Conversely, stock selection in the materials sector was the primary detractor from relative performance partially due to a decline in The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), a leading provider of potash and phosphate fertilizers. The company has seen faster-than-expected price declines from the highs reached after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, as supplies from Belarus and Russia gradually found their way around the global sanctions. Also, higher cost inflation has delayed discretionary fertilizer purchases by farmers. However, we believe the global agricultural cycle remains broadly supportive. With fertilizer prices normalizing above the pre-pandemic levels, pent up demand from farmers’ need to replenish diminished soil land banks, and continued pressure on Belarussian and Russian supplies, we believe the company’s earnings power will remain at above-history levels. Additionally, the company’s commitment to share repurchases and debt paydowns has accreted value to existing shareholders and signaled a commitment by management to continue to do so.”

“In spring 2023, a number of high-profile regional banks, none of which we owned, collapsed over the course of a few weeks. In contrast, the select, large banks we own, including Capital One Financial, actually saw deposit inflows and increasing profits, reinforcing our thesis that high-quality financial services companies remain among the most misunderstood and attractive sectors of the market. This stress test models a dramatic recession—one meaningfully worse than the great financial crisis of 2008-2009. It includes a 3.5% decline in gross domestic product, a 10% unemployment rate, a 37% decline in residential real estate, a 40% decline in commercial real estate and a 55% decline in the stock market. The resilience and strength required to weather such an economic storm combined with proven economies of scale in branding and technology should drive DNYVF market share gains and growth for years to come. Trading at some of the lowest valuations in the market, our financial sector holdings—such as Capital One Financial, deserve to be revalued upwards over time. In the meantime, increasing dividends and a shrinking share base create value while we wait.”

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Just Bought and Sold.
Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time. His net worth stands at about $120 billion as of November 21, 2023, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The Oracle of Omaha is one of the very few individuals on the Forbes' billionaire list who made this wealth purely by investing in the stock market. But Buffett did not become the master of the game overnight. He inherited investing wisdom from his father who was a US Congressman and later a stock broker. While strong family connections did give Buffett an opportunity to raise funds in early stages of his career, he made his way up to the ranks of success by pure ability and sticking to value investing principles propended by the Benjamin Graham school of investing.
Warren Buffett's Investment Philosophy
Every year Warren Buffett reiterates the basic principles of his investing philosophy in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This philosophy is dramatically simple and eventually boils down to this: Buffett likes to invest in businesses that he believes will keep growing and because of their growth and performance the Oracle of Omaha loves to own a stake in them and hold it forever. In his 2022 letter to investors Buffett said:
Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative destruction.” One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.""
Warren Buffett, who had already achieved the status of a millionaire by 1962, took control of Berkshire Hathaway back in 1965 which was at that time a textile company. Today the company has a market cap of close to $800 billion, spans 40 industries and 60 companies.
Warren Buffett is a huge fan of making a few but optimal decisions instead of hyper diversifying and making many decisions. In last year’s letter to shareholders, Buffett said his company’s satisfactory performance was the product of “about a dozen truly good decisions – that would be about one every five years – and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors such as Berkshire.” Berkshire Hathaway Performance and Returns
Berkshire's compounded annual gain from 1965 through 2022 came in at 19.8%, compared with S&P 500’s gain of 9.9% during the same period. The S&P 500 gained 24,708% between 1965 and 2022. Berkshire Hathaway on the other hand gained a whopping 3,787,464% over the same period.

Our Methodology

17 Stocks Warren Buffett Just Bought and Sold
17. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)
Stake Value: completely sold
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a stock in which Warren Buffett completely sold his stakes during the third quarter of 2023. Berkshire Hathaway sold all 22 million General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shares it had in the third quarter.
Recently, it was reported that United Auto Workers’ deal with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) cleared its last hurdle as it got approved by the last batch of union workers.
16. Activision
Stake Value: completely sold
Warren Buffett’s hedge fund had about 14.7 million Activision shares during the second quarter of 2023. The fund sold all these shares in the September quarter. Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision is successfully clearing all regulatory hurdles. Last month Microsoft said it has started offers to eligible holders to exchange any and all outstanding notes issued by Activision for up to $3.65 billion of new notes and cash.
Aristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“We first purchased Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), one of the largest video game companies in the world, during the second quarter of 2023. We have long appreciated the critical role Activision Blizzard’s gaming franchises play for PlayStation, Xbox and the broader gaming industry. Moreover, we believe the company is on the path toward increasing its revenue from new products that rely on in‐game transactions and advertising, as well as through further leveraging its intellectual property from consoles and PCs into mobile games. At the time of purchase, there was heightened uncertainty regarding whether regulators would approve the pending acquisition of the company by Microsoft, a current Value Equity holding. This, we believe, provided an opportunity for us to own Activision Blizzard at an attractive discount to our estimates of intrinsic value should the company remain independent. Conversely, if the transaction commenced and Activision Blizzard was indeed acquired, we would still benefit through our investment in Microsoft. As such, rather than attempting to predict regulatory approval of the transaction, we instead saw the company as an optimal investment. With the uncertainties regarding regulatory approval nearly disappearing, we decided to exit our investment.”
15. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)
Stake Value: completely sold
Warren Buffett’s hedge fund Berkshire had owned about 59,000 United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) shares as of the end of the second quarter of 2023.

ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”
14. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)

In its Q3 earnings call, Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) talked about its guidance:
Given the strength of our Q3 and year-to-date performance, strong volume/mix momentum across our brands and overall demand resilience, we are now raising our full year outlook for both revenue and EPS. We now expect top line growth of 14% to 15% versus our original outlook of 5% to 7% and most recent outlook of 12% plus.

Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. The range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rate that is likely to occur through calendar year ‘24 as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-dismissed-hybrid-vehicles-001230004.html,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn’t think highly of hybrid vehicles. Last year he dismissed them as a “phase” and said it’s “time to move on.” But Toyota doubled down on them—and the move has proved prescient.
Hybrid sales have been on a tear in 2023, jumping 48% in the first three quarters compared to the same year-ago period, the Wall Street Journal reported. Last year, hybrid sales dropped about 6% compared with 2021.
“It’s a smoking-hot market,” David Christ, head of sales for Toyota’s North American business, told the paper, adding that Toyota is making as many hybrids—which save fuel by combining a gasoline engine with an electric motor—as it can.
Demand for electric vehicles, meanwhile, has chilled. The market is still expanding, but the pace of growth has slowed considerably. After growing 63% globally in the first half of last year, it rose only 49% in the same period this year, the Journal reported.
That has carmakers rethinking investments in EV production, among them GM and Ford. Part of the problem is that the first wave of buyers has already bought their EVs, and the next group of would-be buyers is less willing and more price-sensitive.
“A large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt, they have got credit card debt, mortgage debt,” Musk said on a third-quarter results call last month. “We have to make our cars more affordable.”
His comments came as Tesla disclosed its lowest quarterly earnings per share in two years, coming in 10% below already negative analyst forecasts.
Ford in its third quarter, meanwhile, reported a 41% increase in hybrid sales—easily outpacing EV sales—and said it expects to quadruple them in the next five years.
All this leaves Toyota chairman and former CEO Akio Toyoda, long a skeptic of the hype surrounding electric vehicles, feeling vindicated. He’s long felt the industry should hedge its bets on EVs by continuing to invest in hybrids and hydrogen-powered cars.
“People are finally seeing reality,” he said recently.
A little over a year ago, he told dealers gathered in Las Vegas that electric vehicles “are just going to take longer than the media would like us to believe... Toyota is a department store of all sorts of powertrains. It’s not right for the department store to say, ‘This is the product you should buy.’”
Last year, Toyoda resigned as CEO as investors clamored for Toyota to do more by way of all-electric vehicles.
“Toyota is not correctly responding to calls from the market to take a lead in electric vehicles,” Satoru Aoyama, senior director at Fitch Ratings, told the Financial Times in October last year, warning the company could “lose investor confidence.”
As it turns out, more confidence was merited, not less.

After beating General Motors and Ford in US electric vehicle (EV) sales in Q3, Hyundai Motor Group plans to keep its momentum going in the market.
Hyundai officially launched its new state-of-the-art Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore (HMGICS) this week1, a “smart urban mobility hub” run by robots, robot dogs and artificial intelligence (AI).
With the aid of 200 robots, the facility has the capacity to produce 30,000 customizable EVs annually, showcasing a revolutionary cell-based production system.
The robots play a crucial role, handling 50% of all tasks, including assembly, inspection, production, and 60% of component processing, ordering, and transport, allowing human workers to focus on more creative and strategic tasks.
The tech hub also provides a unique immersive experience that includes flexible vehicle customization, test drives, VR factory tours, and even a “smart farm” where robots cultivate vegetables.
While robotics integration is an ongoing trend in the automotive industry, security and defense is another sector increasingly using robots to bolster human ability.
North America, a leader in robotics innovation and a major market, is increasingly adopting security robots across various industries due to their reliability and effectiveness in surveillance.2
The rise in defense spending and the need to address threats like terrorism, piracy, and border security challenges are driving the market expansion. The Security Robot Market is valued at $14 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach$26.11 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.57% during the forecast period.
These robots, now equipped with advanced technology, are becoming essential in safeguarding public spaces without seeming threatening, thus gaining cultural acceptance.
At the forefront of the robot security market is Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP), a security technology company deploying autonomous security robots (ASRs) and blue light emergency communication systems across America.

Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC's (LON:MONY) Financials ...,1 month ago,Ford Motor Company (F) Rises Higher Than Market: Key Facts. 21h ago ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us · Terms...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moneysupermarket-com-group-plcs-lon-115613993.html,"Moneysupermarket.com Group's (LON:MONY) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Moneysupermarket.com Group's ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
View our latest analysis for Moneysupermarket.com Group
How Is ROE Calculated?
The formula for return on equity is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Moneysupermarket.com Group is:
36% = UK£77m ÷ UK£211m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn £0.36 in profit.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
Moneysupermarket.com Group's Earnings Growth And 36% ROE
To begin with, Moneysupermarket.com Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.0% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Moneysupermarket.com Group's net income shrunk at a rate of 8.7% over the past five years. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.
So, as a next step, we compared Moneysupermarket.com Group's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 5.4% over the last few years.
past-earnings-growth
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MONY? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.
Is Moneysupermarket.com Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?
With a high three-year median payout ratio of 100% (implying that 0.3% of the profits are retained), most of Moneysupermarket.com Group's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent.
In addition, Moneysupermarket.com Group has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 69% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.
Summary
Overall, we have mixed feelings about Moneysupermarket.com Group. In spite of the high ROE, the company has failed to see growth in its earnings due to it paying out most of its profits as dividend, with almost nothing left to invest into its own business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Watchlists · My Portfolio · Markets · News · Videos ·  Yahoo Finance Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-10-58-time-put-110033985.html,"Let's talk about the popular Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$12.64 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$9.70. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ford Motor's current trading price of US$10.58 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
View our latest analysis for Ford Motor
Is Ford Motor Still Cheap?
According to my valuation model, Ford Motor seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ford Motor today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $12.12, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ford Motor's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in F’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on F, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Ford Motor at this point in time. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.

Ford (F) Updates Outlook After Ratification of Labor Contract,1 month ago,Ford Motor Company F provided a full-year 2023 guidance for operating ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-updates-outlook-ratification-130600619.html,"Ford Motor Company F provided a full-year 2023 guidance for operating results after withdrawing it amid the United Automobile Workers’ (“UAW”) strike. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the band of $10-$10.5 billion, down from the previously forecasted range of $11-$12 billion in July.

The automaker said that rising labor costs from new labor contracts would result in lower profits than previously estimated. It expects labor costs to increase by $8.8 billion over the life of the contract. Gross wages, accelerated wage progression and cost-of-living adjustments are believed to be the main contributors to rising costs.

The trimmed guidance for adjusted EBIT includes a $1.7 billion strike-related loss, of which $1.6 billion was incurred in the fourth quarter due to lower-than-anticipated production of high-margin trucks and sports utility vehicles (“SUVs”). The wholesale production was around 100,000 units lower than expected due to work stoppage.

Per John Lawler, chief financial officer of Ford, the cost impact is estimated to be around $900 per vehicle by 2028 or around 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin. Ford will strive to offset the cost through enhanced productivity and lower spending.

In the first nine months of 2023, Ford generated net income and adjusted EBIT of $4.9 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively. For full-year 2023, the automaker expects adjusted free cash flow in the range of $5-$5.5 billion.

The invention of the automobile wasn’t as significant as the invention of the modern factory to produce it. That’s according to experienced automaker Elon Musk.
In an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Musk called Henry Ford a “next-level genius” for reimagining the way factories operate. In 1913, he famously installed the first conveyor-belt assembly line for cars at a Michigan factory, creating a new form of mass production that proved revolutionary.

'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepare
“Ford deserves a tremendous amount of credit,” Musk said. “In fact, Ford is really responsible for the entire mass manufacturing industry because he actually founded Cadillac, which was the heart of General Motors. Then he got kicked out and started Ford.”
To be clear, Cadillac was founded in 1902 with the remnants of Ford’s first automobile venture five months after he left the company. The brand was based on a single-cylinder engine developed by Henry M. Leland. It would go on to become a part of General Motors in 1909.
Nevertheless, Ford was clearly the pioneer of lean manufacturing, which revolutionized automaking and made his third venture, Ford Motor Company, a massive success.
Toyota
Ford’s lean manufacturing technique inspired Toyota's (TM) Kiichiro Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno to implement similar cost-saving strategies and ramp up production. The duo used Ford’s ideas to create their “Just-in-Time” philosophy, which was yet another revolutionary change for global manufacturing.
To cut costs and eliminate waste, Toyota focuses on manufacturing only ""what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed."" That means all the parts and equipment needed to manufacture a vehicle on the factory floor are arranged in a way to minimize the time it takes to get from order to delivery.
These innovative manufacturing techniques have helped the company boost production while maintaining quality. Today, Toyota is the largest car maker in the world, producing nearly 10 million vehicles every year. In terms of revenue, it’s the second-largest auto company in the world. Toyota generated $275.2 billion in revenue in the fiscal year that ended in March 2023.
Nike
Athletic footwear might not be the first thing you associate with cutting-edge manufacturing, but Nike (NKE) proves that you should.
Researchers studied the audits of more than 300 factories in Nike’s supply chain across 11 countries and discovered lean manufacturing processes throughout the system. They say this not only reduced costs and boosted efficiency but also led to better compliance with labor standards in different countries.

Nike’s efficient factory floors reduce costs while its excellent marketing bolsters premium pricing. This is reflected in its wide profit margins. The company’s gross margin has always been above 42% for the past decade, with the exception of the quarter ended May 2020. Meanwhile, the stock is trading at 32.9 times earnings per share.
Investors looking for a lean manufacturing machine with a robust brand should certainly add Nike to their list.
Deere & Company
The maker of tractors, diesel engines and lawn care equipment invested $100 million in 2003 to move from mass manufacturing to lean manufacturing. The process allowed the company to significantly reduce the size of its factory floors and boost output. Deere & Company (DE) is a market leader with 37% market share in the tractors and agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, according to IBISWorld.
The stock is up almost 134% over the past five years, outperforming the S&P 500, which has delivered about 65% over the same period. It’s now trading at just 10.9 times earnings per share.
The firm's iron grip on this market, coupled with a strong brand and lean manufacturing, should put it on every investor’s radar.

The automotive market is a diverse one and includes companies including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), component manufacturers, dealerships, and commercial vehicle manufacturers, among others. Automotive technology is poised for change across the world with electric vehicles challenging internal combustion engines and autonomous driving set to disrupt the whole transportation experience and industry. Vehicles are becoming increasingly “smart” to the point where they have turned into “software-defined” vehicles. Latest advancements and updates can be implemented remotely through software changes, a development unthinkable barely few years ago.
The technological changes are also having their impact on the dealership and retail sale side of the picture. Dealerships have been forced to upgrade their sales platforms to include an ever increasing online presence in the form of marketplaces and platforms in addition to the brick-and-mortar dealerships. There is an increasing demand for quick and streamlined sales processes through online platforms without a need for physical visitation. In addition, technology is also helping the distribution network to improve efficiencies across the board through implementation of advanced supply chain management solutions.
Governments around the world have implemented policies that promote and enable the shift towards electric vehicles with the objective of reducing carbon emissions. The European Union has legislated that the OEMs are required to reduce average emissions by 55% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. This translates to selling battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) from 2035 onwards. Several companies have announced their own decarbonization plans, such as Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which intends to achieve “100% passenger car battery electric vehicles (BEVs) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the U.S. by end of 2030.”
Despite these bold plans and technological advancements, or maybe because of it, the industry is mired with new challenges. Software-defined vehicles require higher number of semiconductors, the shortage of which caused massive problems for automotive manufacturers in the recent past. In addition, the promulgation of software systems raises cyber security concerns related to these vehicles. On the other hand, the scale of transition to new energy vehicles demanded in the upcoming years requires a massive infrastructure undertaking ranging from manufacturing plants and mining operations to charging stations and electric grid networks.
On the human resource side of things, three leading automaker, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), were recently struck by labor strikes in United States. United Auto Workers, a labor union, launched a strike against the three companies mentioned above on September 15. The strike effected 44 facilities across the United States with more than 30,000 workers off the job for nearly 6 weeks. The strike was called off during last week of October after UAW reached tentative deals, which included 25 percent raise, enhanced retirement benefits and a faster progression to the top pay, with the three companies.

In its Q3 investor letter, Black Bear Value Partners, an investment management firm, made the following comments about Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG):
“Asbury Group operates auto dealerships across the United States. While much attention is paid to the number of cars sold, the strength of the model comes from the back of the house in parts and services where more than 50% of the profits come from. We are exiting a period of high margins on new and used car sales. Shortages of inventory have allowed dealers to make record profits when selling a car. As inventories normalize and interest rates rise, I fully expect the dealers to make less profit (called the GPU) when selling a car. Car prices cannot go up ad-infinitum and at some point, there will be buyer pushback. The lower operating costs of the business are not appreciated by the market. They are appreciated by us and the management teams as most dealers, including ABG, have been buying in lots of stock with their free-cash flow.”

Tesla Is About To Make A Spectacular Electric Pickup Debut,1 month ago,When it comes to pickups Ford Motor (NYSE: F) is arguably king with its F  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-spectacular-electric-pickup-debut-171844355.html,"On November 22nd, just before Thanksgiving, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk made a post on his X platform, revealing that Cybertrucks are on their way to North America stores. With several delays, Tesla is finally to enter the pickup truck segment, bringing in stainless steel design into the picture on November 30th. Moreover, Tesla will be hosting an extravaganza event to honor the occasion and it will be livestreamed on its website.
Tesla Always Makes An Entrance
Although challenging production-wise, Tesla chose stainless steel for its pickup debut. Although hard to manipulate, stainless steel doesn’t need to be painted while also resisting dents which is quite a plus when it comes to a vehicle’s outer shell. If Tesla EVs are something, they are distinctive.
The Cybertruck Needs To Spark Some Excitement
The Cybertruck marks Tesla’s first new passenger model in more than three years. But even Musk admitted during the October’s earnings call that the EV king dug its own grave with this vehicle, as increasing the factory output and making money out of it will be challenging. Musk stated that Tesla is expected to make 25,000 Cybertrucks a year but as of 2025 as the ramp up will be slow. All in all, this is a critical launch for Tesla because not only is the Cybertruck its mark in the year of the electric pickup but also it is its chance to turn things around as it has been facing with intensified competition and a sales slowdown.
Meanwhile, Even Legacy Automakers Are Struggling On The EV Front
When it comes to pickups, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) is arguably king with its F-150 being America’s best-selling vehicle. But even an electric version of this bestselling model didn’t save Ford. Along with the increased costs brought on  by the recent UAW strike, Ford just announced it will be scaling back its $3.5 billion Michigan battery plant investment plans due to disappointing EV demand.  Ford previously announced it will be cutting or delaying $12 billion from its EV strategy.
Toyota Might Have Been Quite Late To The EV Party, But It Is Going For A Win
On the other hand, Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) just unveiled its EV battery roadmap. Since the new CEO, Koji Sato, got behind the helm, Toyota significantly changed its EV tune. With a dramatic expansion in offerings and commitment to develop innovative battery technology, Toyota is aiming to sell as many as 3.5 million EVs a year by the end of the decade. Toyota is also planning to introduce fast-charging, cheaper and space-efficient solid-state batteries in 2027.
Meanwhile, New Players Keep On Coming...
What is perhaps the most exciting part of the new EV era is the developments that promise to redefine transportation. For example, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) revealed last week that its revolutionary portable battery system has entered the testing phase. Today, it added that  the COR battery system will be designed, developed, and assembled in Canada, from both domestic and international parts as it entered into a strategic partnership with a prominent Canadian manufacturer that specializes in electronic boards. With the upcoming Alpha release, COR made a pivatoal step towards its official market launch. Worksport designed the COR battery system to be used both within a pickup truck bed and independently, providing users with the ability to power remote locations and extend the range of their electric pickups. Besides this groundbreaking battery solution, Worksport is also developing a solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS. Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) will be getting a customized version of these two products as Worksport revealed last year it entered into a formal agreement with the Hyundai America Technical Center. Under the agreement, Worksport will be making prototypes of the SOLIS and a customized version of the COR to fit the Hyundai Santa Cruz.
If Tesla is known for anything, it is disruption. With the Cybertruck, it promises to redefine electric pickups and pickups in general. By the looks of it, Tesla promises to end 2023 on a high note with its extravaganza entry into the electric pickup market.

Citigroup discloses billions in one-time  charges and reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-most-religious-freedom-063155059.html,"In this article, we shall discuss 20 countries with the most religious freedom in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the relationship between freedom of religion and economic growth, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in general, go directly and see 10 Countries With The Most Religious Freedom In The World. 
Freedom of Religion and Economic Growth: An Analysis
According to a study by Georgetown University and Brigham Young University, freedom of religious belief is one of the most important factors commonly associated with economic growth. The study considered the GDP growth of more than 170 countries globally in 2011 and accounted for more than 25 different financial, social, and regulatory variables. Whilst this is not conclusive evidence of a positive correlation between freedom of religion and economic growth, it does merit consideration as an unrecognized asset, especially in the current context of consistent macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain constraints, and inflationary pressures. In this vein, the study also sheds light upon the fact that there exists a positive relationship between religious freedom and 10 of the 12 pillars associated with global competitiveness, as measured by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index 2020 especially in some of the countries with the most religious freedom in the world. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) topped the 2023 edition of the REDI Index, which measures a company's commitment to including religion as part of its overall diversity initiatives. You can read more on religions around the world in our article 20 Most Religious Countries in the World. 
According to another report by the World Economic Forum, secular policymaking often leads to higher levels of institutional corruption. The report states that nine of the ten countries which have the highest levels of corruption as per Transparency International have incredibly high governmental restrictions on religious liberty. One such example is North Korea, which is one of the most restrictive countries in the world when it comes to religion and makes our list of 8 Countries Where Religion is Illegal. The basic assumption to this assertion is that religious freedom encourages business leaders to draw on spiritual values and moral teachings as they conduct themselves in the business arena in countries with the most religious freedom in the world. Religious teachings also tend to seep into business ethics.
Furthermore, countries with the most religious freedom in the world tend to minimize violence and conflict, which in turn, is essential for a conducive and productive economic environment. Normal economic activities are sensitive to political and social disruption, with local and foreign investment highly dependent on the degree of stability within the country's internal political climate. Tolerance is critical to peace and stability, which in turn are one of the most important considerations for investors looking to conduct normal and predictable business transactions, primarily in new and emerging markets. Religious restrictions can directly impact economic activity by creating legal barriers for import and export industries. One important example is the halal food industry.
Business operating in countries with the most religious freedom in the world like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are able to avoid major liabilities by complying with the liberal policies of the state and installing mechanisms in place to avoid religious discrimination in the workplace. Furthermore, freedom of religion can enhance pluralism within an organization, which in turn is commonly associated with financial health and economic growth. The active participation of religious minorities within a company, and in society in general, boosts dynamism within the economy, encourages innovation, and contributes millions to the economy through direct spending. 
Integrating Hybrid Work With DE&I Strategies: An Overview
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, millions of people around the world were forced into hybrid models of employment. As the global macroeconomic outlook recovers from the headwinds perpetrated by the Great Resignation, employee preferences have shifted in that more than eighty percent of employees who worked in hybrid models during the pandemic prefer retaining them according to a survey by McKinsey - and many companies are complying and adapting to these newer work models. Employees have reported that they are twice as likely to look for new opportunities elsewhere if they are asked to return in a full-time, on-site capacity. However, despite such popular support for hybrid work models, religious, ethnic, and racial minorities have found it difficult to navigate the inclusion landscape from a hybrid setting. They have claimed that whilst it is true that hybrid work offers greater flexibility and better work-life balance, it is also imperative to note that hybrid work tends to create unequal playing fields and prioritizes in-groups at the expense of out-groups. For companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) which have demonstrated a commitment to diversify and retain employees, adopting ill-advised hybrid work models could exacerbate the headwinds perpetrated by the pandemic by maximizing departures, decreasing inclusion, harming morale, and hindering performance. 
According to McKinsey, to construct a more inclusive hybrid workspace, data will likely prove to be incredibly useful in understanding the working-model preferences of the diverse demographics of an organization. It is also known that the behavior of managers and teams on a day-to-day basis is the most potent determinant of employee experience within a given workspace, followed by the liberal nature of countries with the most religious freedom in the world. Companies must also inculcate a culture of mutual respect by creating norms which push employees to view each other as members of the human race and not merely co-workers. Organizations must train employees to inquire about each other's preferences and boundaries for working styles and communication. For hybrid work specifically, this might also include increased levels of experimentation with mixing different types of meetings.
Secondly, companies which are leading the DE&I initiative globally, like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are also diverting greater investment in fostering a workplace culture which encourages employees to learn with and from each other. Blunders are reframed as opportunities to learn. This usually requires significant investment in the way of training employees to adopt ""growth mindsets"" which further encourage teamwide development. Team events and excursions aid the construction of invaluable bonds which are essential preconditions to a conducive and profitable work environment. 
Countries With The Most Religious Freedom In The World
Our Methodology
To compile our list of the 20 countries with the most religious freedom in the world, we adopted a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied religious freedom and tolerance in countries around the world (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). We then shortlisted more than 50 countries which appeared most frequently during our research. We then thoroughly examined the constitutional and legal provisions of each country, assessed government policies from 2008 to 2023, and consulted public opinion surveys from each country. Since freedom of religion is an incredibly multidimensional and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the level of religious freedom in each country; the criteria is premised on freedom of expression provisions within each country's legal framework (20 points), social tolerance (15 points), and state response to incidents of discrimination (10 points). We then proceeded to award each country a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 countries which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the freedom of expression provisions within each country's legal framework.
Many countries which made our list of 20 countries with the most religious freedom in the world also featured on our list of 30 Countries with the Best Economy in the World Right Now.

Ecopro BM Co., which produces cathode-active materials, surged as much as 26% in Seoul trading, while SK IE Technology Co., which makes separators used in EV batteries, rose 14%. L&F Co. jumped 8.3% and LG Energy Solution Ltd. — the biggest battery maker outside China — gained 1.8% in Seoul trading. In contrast, China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s largest battery maker, fell 2.6% to trade at its lowest since March 2021.
The Biden administration’s rules, announced Friday, aim to increase supply-chain security by blocking EV manufacturers from sourcing battery materials from China and other foreign adversaries. The guidelines, which were required as part of a deal to extend the $7,500 tax credit through Biden’s signature climate law, establish a 25% ownership threshold for a company or group to be classified as a foreign entity of concern, government speak for businesses or groups owned or controlled by US geopolitical foes.

Hana Securities said in a note that the restriction of licensing deals between US automakers and Chinese battery companies would be good for South Korean battery firms. For example, Ford Motor Co. had planned to license CATL’s lithium iron phosphate battery technology for use in a planned $3.5 billion EV battery plant. Work on the controversial factory was suspended in September.
Some Korean companies, however, have partnerships in which Chinese firms have stakes of more than the 25% threshold to be classified as a foreign entity of concern. They include LG Chem Ltd., Posco Holdings Inc. and Ecopro Materials Co., which have established, or are planning, joint ventures with Chinese companies to produce battery materials in South Korea. Vehicles containing any battery components manufactured or assembled by so-called foreign entity of concerns won’t qualify for the tax credit.
LG Chem shares dropped as much as 3.2% on Monday and Posco Holdings slid as much as 2.1%.
Representatives from South Korea’s trade ministry met with battery companies on Saturday and said they would help them diversify supply chains for key materials.
Read More: Chinese Firms Are Seeking Korean Partners to Skirt US EV Rules
Those ventures were set up as an attempt to skirt the restrictions, given that South Korea has a free-trade agreement with the US, and batteries made there and then installed in US-made electric cars may qualify for the tax breaks. South Korean companies may now look to restructure those deals to meet the new guidelines.
Cathode maker Posco Future M Co. has clauses in contracts to change stakeholdings for future joint ventures with Chinese partners if neccesary, according to a text message from the company. Posco Future has two ventures with a Chinese firm to produce EV battery materials and may use them for regions outside US, it said.
“There are still unclear clauses in the guidelines,” said James Oh, vice president at SNE Research. “We can’t technically say whether private companies in China, like CATL, are under ‘effective control’ of the Chinese government or not. Chinese battery firm Gotion’s largest shareholder is Volkswagen — how can we say they are under the Chinese Communist Party’s control?”

Auto Roundup: TM's $60M Penalty NSANY's Wage Hike & More,1 month ago,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Toyota Motor  Corporation ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto  · Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-roundup-tms-60m-penalty-134700587.html,"Auto giants with production facilities in the United States are increasing wages of non-union employees following the United Auto Workers' (UAW) record-setting deals with the Detroit Three automakers.The UAW labor agreements with General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA until 2028 feature a 25% boost in base wages, including an immediate 11% rise. This cumulative increase will elevate the top wage by 33%, incorporating estimated cost-of-living adjustments, reaching over $42 per hour. Additionally, the agreements will eliminate wage tiers in factories and streamline the progression to earn the top wage from eight years to three years.
In recent weeks, auto biggies like Hyundai, Honda, Subaru and Toyota TM increased wages for non-union U.S. factory workers, indicating a response to the union's growing focus on organizing the workforce in foreign-owned auto plants. Last week, Japan’s Nissan NSANY and Germany’s Volkswagen also announced wage hikes for U.S. workers.
Meanwhile, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association released data on new car registrations for October 2023. The European Union (“EU”) car market rose 14.6% last month to 855,484 units, marking the 15th straight month of growth. Most EU markets witnessed robust growth. Registrations in Spain, France and Italy rose 18.1%, 21.9% and 20%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Germany saw an increase of 4.9% in registrations last month. In the first 10 months of 2023, EU market vehicle registrations reached 9 million units, up 16.7% year over year. During January-October, the majority of markets recorded double-digit percentage growth, with the top four being Spain (18.5%), Italy (20.4%), France (16.5%) and Germany (13.5%).
On the news front, Toyota's credit division is set to pay $60 million in fines for illegal lending practices and violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Ford will reduce investment in its $3.5 billion Michigan battery plant due to lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles (EVs), high cost of labor and the company's cost-cut strategy. Close peer General Motors’ self-driving unit, Cruise, has hit a roadblock. It is facing a critical safety crisis, which has cast a shadow on its ambitious vision to revolutionize urban transportation.  Amid the challenges, the company has scaled back its robotaxi ambitions to one city. Italian-American automaker Stellantis joined forces with CAL to localize the supply of LFP batteries in the European market.
Last Week’s Top Stories
Toyota has been charged for illegally preventing car buyers from canceling add-ons to their loans that increased their monthly loan payments and deteriorated buyers’ credit reports. The automaker will pay $60 million in fines to settle the U.S. regulator's charges. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), Toyota Motor Credit will pay a $12 million civil fine and $48 million to the harmed consumers since 2016. Toyota Motor Credit provides vehicle financing to customers who buy vehicles from Toyota dealerships.
The settlement revolves around add-on products that cost the buyers nearly $700-$2,500 per loan. The add-ons provide protection when vehicles are damaged, stolen or out of warranty and in case the buyer dies or becomes disabled. Per CFPB, the borrowers complained to Toyota Motor Credit that dealers misinformed them about the necessity of the product and rushed them through paperwork, because of which they didn’t realize how much they were paying. The company is accused of violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act by misinforming credit reporting agencies and failing to correct the misinformation for more than 27,500 borrowers.

Ford announced scalingback its plan for a $3.5 billion Michigan Battery plant due to lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, high cost of labor and the company’s cost-cutting strategy. The facility was announced in February. The U.S. legacy automaker will cut the plant’s production capacity by nearly 43% to 20 gigawatt hours per year and reduce expected employment to 1,700 jobs, down from 2,500 jobs. The company refused to disclose the reduced amount of investment in the plant. The move follows a recent retreat from EVs by automakers around the globe amid declining demand due to higher costs, supply chain & battery technology-related challenges.
Last month, Ford announced cutting or delaying $12 billion in its previously announced investment. The scale-back plan is part of the same announcement. Ford will also delay the construction of the Kentucky EV battery plant. Per Mark Truby, chief communications officer of Ford, despite a halt in construction of the plant due to collective bargaining with UAW, the plant is still expected to open in 2026. The construction of the Michigan plant is set to resume after being paused for two months.
General Motors’ Cruise is scaling back its plans and is now focusing on deploying autonomous vehicles in just one city instead of the previously targeted 13 across the United States. The specific city and the timeline for this deployment remain undisclosed. Additionally, GM has postponed the production of the much-anticipated Cruise Origin robotaxi. Cruise is completing a small number of pre-commercial prototypes. However, the full-scale production remains on hold. The company will not manufacture any prototype or commercial model of Origin in 2024.
This comes amid regulatory and safety hurdles. California's suspension of Cruise's driverless permits has led to a nationwide operational pause. The company's troubles were further compounded by the departure of its founding executives, Kyle Vogt and Daniel Kan.
The Cruise Origin, a central piece of the company's autonomous strategy, was set to be produced at GM's Factory Zero in Detroit. There were plans for its deployment in U.S. cities and Tokyo but regulatory approvals have stalled the process. GM has been awaiting a decision from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on an exemption request for federal safety standards since February 2022
Stellantis signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. to localize the supply of lithium iron phosphate batteries and cells to power the automaker’s EV production in Europe. To underpin Stellantis’ aggressive electric push, both companies are contemplating a joint venture with an equal contribution. The MoU highlights a long-term collaboration between both companies on two strategic fronts. Firstly, devise a bold technology roadmap to support Stellantis’ cutting-edge battery EVs and secondly, identify opportunities to strengthen the battery chain value.
Per Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis, both companies will bring innovative and accessible battery technology to Stellantis’ customers while helping the company achieve its carbon net zero ambition by 2038.As part of the Dare Forward 2030 plan, Stellantis aims to achieve a 100% EV sales mix in Europe and a 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by the end of the decade. It is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity to achieve these targets, underpinned by six battery manufacturing plants in North America and Europe. The company is assembling a roster of partnerships to support a stable, low-carbon supply of crucial materials for its electrified future.
Nissan announced a wage hike for its 9,000 US factory workers after the UAW reached new contracts with the Detroit Three. The wage hike of 10% will be effective from Jan 8, 2024, for production, maintenance and tool & die technicians. Workers who are not at the top salary scale will also be eligible for the hike. The automaker also decided to eliminate wage tiers for U.S. production workers.Nissan slashed the number of years it takes for an employee to get top pay from eight years to three years. It will increase the wages of temporary workers by 150% and make them permanent employees.
Additional benefits encompass the inclusion of Juneteenth and Veterans Day as paid holidays, along with an extension of paid parental leave by an extra eight weeks, totaling 16 weeks and covering both parents. Per Brian Brockman, spokesperson of Nissan, the move is aimed at attracting and retaining top talents in the industry. The company also stated that the hike reflects its commitment to its employees in the United States.

The Cheongju, South Korea-based firm inked a contract Friday with Samsung to supply cathode-active materials worth 43.8 trillion won ($33.5 billion) between 2024 and 2028, according to a company filing released after the stock market closed in Seoul. The cathode is based on nickel-cobalt-aluminum chemistry and is used for high-nickel batteries, Ecopro said in the filing.
Ecopro’s cathodes will be provided to Samsung’s plants in South Korea and abroad, the filing said, without elaborating. Samsung is planning two battery plants jointly with Stellantis NV in Kokomo, Indiana, and has a plant in Hungary.
The massive deal comes as carmakers slashed sales targets for EVs with higher interest rates hurting automobile purchases. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has set rigorous limits on sourcing battery minerals from China and other foreign adversaries. That has created an opportunity for countries like South Korea along with challenges for them to reduce their heavy reliance on Chinese components.

ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ford Motor?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Ford Motor does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ford Motor's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 7.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. We would also like to add that the Ford family owns a significant portion of the company's Class B stock (40% voting rights as per the latest annual report).
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
Insider Ownership Of Ford Motor
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can see that insiders own shares in Ford Motor Company. Insiders own US$547m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Ford Motor. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Ford Motor (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.
But ultimately it is the future , not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .

Ford (F) Invests in Indonesia Plant to Secure Nickel for EV,1 month ago,Ford Motor Company F is investing in a battery-nickel plant in Indonesia to  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-invests-indonesia-plant-132500990.html,"Ford Motor Company F is investing in a battery-nickel plant in Indonesia to strengthen its supply chain. It is collaborating with PT Vale Indonesia and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. in a project to produce 120,000 tons of nickel chemicals per year for electric vehicle (“EV”) batteries, per Bloomberg.

The nickel plant called Pomalaa, which is currently under construction, is likely to commence commercial production in 2026. Although the share of investment of each company in the project is unknown, the total investment is estimated to be around $4.5 billion.

In light of the rising demand for EVs, automakers are striving to secure raw materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel for EV batteries. Ford’s arch-rivals have also shown interest in similar investments. In January, General Motors invested $650 million in a lithium mine in the United States. Also, Tesla is planning on buying a lithium producer.

Amid growing refinery investment in Indonesia, the country has become a significant producer of battery-compatible nickel.

Per Lisa Drake, vice president of Ford's EV Programs and Energy Supply Chain, the direct investment in plants allows Ford to source nickel in cost-efficient ways. It also allows the automaker to keep the amount of nickel mined in line with the company’s sustainability target.

Ford aims to produce more than 2 million EVs by 2026-end. By 2030, it expects EVs to account for 50% of its global sales, which will cement its position in the red-hot EV landscape.

Xcel Energy (XEL) & Ford to Install 30000 EV Charging Ports,1 month ago,XEL and Ford Pro the commercial division of Ford Motor Company F  announced ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-xel-ford-install-141200225.html,"Xcel Energy Inc. XEL and Ford Pro, the commercial division of Ford Motor Company F, announced a collaboration to support the deployment of 30,000 electric vehicle (EV) charging ports in Xcel Energy’s service territories across the United States by 2030. Most of the upfront costs will be offset by XEL, and Ford Pro will provide charging equipment and post-installation customer service and support.

Both companies are launching the 30x30 project as part of Xcel Energy's larger Electric Vehicle Supply Infrastructure (EVSI) program. The idea is to expand EV adoption and expand corporate fleets' access to charging infrastructure throughout the company’s service regions in the United States.

Beginning 2024, the 30x30 program will be available in Colorado and Wisconsin through Xcel Energy's EVSI program. The program will look for growth opportunities in other states within XEL’s service territories, including Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas, over the next six years.

In addition, Xcel Energy and Ford Pro plan to use telemetry data collected from participating vehicles to encourage commercial charging during peak hours, which will help reduce emissions to the grid and save money for customers.
XEL’s Focus on Electric Mobility
Xcel Energy is focused on undertaking initiatives to produce and deliver clean energy to customers, which will help in achieving the net-zero emission target by 2050. The company’s increasing portfolio of EV programs, innovative solutions, robust support and charging infrastructure aims to accelerate the future of zero-carbon transportation.

The company is ambitiously driving toward a goal to enable one out of five vehicles to be electric by 2030, helping customers save $1 billion annually on fuel and cutting down transportation related emissions.
Promising EV Prospects
Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), in the net zero scenario, the use of EVs is going to increase globally and EV sales are set to contribute around 65% to total car sales in 2030. EV sales increased 55% in 2022 compared with the 2021 level. IEA expects sales to improve approximately 25% every year during 2023-2030.

A well-organized EV charging network will be necessary due to the enormous rise in EV usage over the next few years, which will also help reduce emissions from vehicles.

Along with Xcel Energy, other electric power companies like Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK have also been expanding their footprint in the EV market.

In October 2023, Exelon’s unit ComEd, in partnership with Millennium Garages, announced its plan to install up to 300 total EV chargers at the downtown Chicago parking complex by 2026. This will expand charging infrastructure and support State’s goal of opening Illinois’ roads to 1 million EVs by 2030.

EXC’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.3%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last four quarters.

Duke Energy has been focusing on the growing EV market. The company aims to convert all of its 4,000 light-duty vehicles and 50% of its 6,000 medium-duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030.

DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 6.1%.
Price Performance
In the past three months, shares of XEL have risen 8.6% against the industry’s 4% decline.

Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and  reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fords-us-vehicle-sales-slip-142347981.html,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor posted a 0.5% drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for November on Monday, as the automaker worked to restart some of its key plants following a lengthy workers' strike that impacted vehicle production.
However, sales of Ford's electric vehicles such as its F-150 Lightning pickup truck and Mustang Mach-E, jumped 43.2% to 8,958 units from a year earlier.
Shares of the automaker were up 1.4% in afternoon trade.
Ford reached a deal with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in late October, ending an over month-long strike the company said will cost it $1.7 billion.
Sales in October also fell 5.3% for Ford, even though analysts had said the Detroit Three automakers had built up inventory in anticipation of the strike.
Ford said in November all its affected plants had been restarted, a month after Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said restarting the plants would be complicated after the deal, which UAW workers ratified in November.
Sales of Ford trucks slipped 2.8% in November to 78,971 units from a year earlier, while hybrid vehicle sales rose 75.2% to 12,108 units.
The company reported total sales of 145,559 vehicles in the month, compared with 146,364 units.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners ·  Personal...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-floor-decor-highlighted-zacks-132100850.html,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – December 6, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares The Progressive Corp PGR as the Bull of the Day and Floor & Decor Holdings FND as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford Motor Company F, Volvo VLVLY and BYD Company Ltd. BYDDY.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.
Bull of the Day:
The Progressive Corp, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a massive American insurance company. Analysts have taken their expectations higher across the board, particularly following its latest quarterly release back in mid-October.
In addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the company resides within the Zacks Insurance – Property & Casualty industry, currently ranked in the top 13% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a deeper look at the company.
The Progressive Corp.
Progressive snapped a streak of negative surprises in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 20% and posting a modest 0.3% revenue surprise.
Drilling a bit deeper, Progressive saw total Policies in Force grow 10% from the year-ago period, reflecting continued business momentum. PGR shares enjoyed buying pressure following the print, now heading toward all-time highs.
It’s worth noting that Progressive shares have been monster performers in general over the last decade, delivering a remarkable 23% annualized return vs. the S&P 500’s 12.3%.
In addition, the stock could be a target among growth-focused investors, as reflected by its Style Score of “A” for Growth. Consensus estimates for its current fiscal year (FY23) suggest 34% earnings growth paired with an 18% sales climb, with expectations for FY24 suggesting earnings and revenue growth rates of 49% and 13%, respectively.
The company’s revenue growth has remained steady.
Bottom Line
Investors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.
The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.
The Progressive Corp. would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
Bear of the Day:
Floor & Decor Holdings is a multi-channel specialty retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), with analysts taking their earnings expectations lower across the board.
In addition, the company resides in the Zacks Building Products – Wood industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 27% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a closer look at its current standing.
Floor & Decor
Floor & Decor has faced a challenging environment amid broader economic challenges (housing affordability, slower sales of large-ticket discretionary purchases), with earnings forecasted to pull back roughly 20% in its current year on 2.5% higher revenues.
Earnings growth resumes modestly in FY24, with consensus expectations alluding to 0.6% growth paired with an 8% sales bump.
Shares are a bit expensive given the forecasted growth, with the current 44.5X forward earnings multiple (F1) undoubtedly on the higher end of the spectrum and above the 38.9X five-year median.
The current value is also well above the respective Zacks industry average of 28.2X. The stock carries a Style Score of “D” for Value.
Shares saw bullish activity post-earnings following its latest earnings release, helping spark a rally. Concerning headline figures, FND posted an 11% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate and reported revenue modestly below expectations.
As shown below, the recent rally post-earnings has pushed shares above the 200-day daily moving average, a level that’s consistently seen action in previous instances. It looks worthwhile for investors to see if shares can hold and continue trading above this level, helping to further establish a meaningful positive trend.
Bottom Line
Negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.
Floor & Decor Holdings is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.
For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.

The Company's...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbon-revolution-plc-awarded-program-113000241.html,"Carbon Revolution Limited
One of Two Previously Announced OEM Programs Awarded in Recent Months
GEELONG, Australia, Dec. 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company”) a Tier 1 OEM supplier and a leading global manufacturer of lightweight advanced technology carbon fiber wheels, announced today that it has been awarded a program by a premium brand of a major German automaker, one of two previously announced OEM wheel programs awarded in recent months.
“We are very excited to expand our reach with this strategically important German OEM,” said Carbon Revolution CEO Jake Dingle. ""We believe this is a testament to the strength and value proposition of our technology. We look forward to continuing to grow our customer base with the largest and most sophisticated global OEMs.”
Overall, the Company has been awarded 18 vehicle programs for six global OEMs including Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Renault, Ferrari N.V. and Jaguar Land Rover and intends to continue to expand its portfolio of global automaker clients as demand grows for its disruptive efficiency technology.
Carbon Revolution wheels weigh up to 50% less than comparable aluminum wheels, and can provide an up to 5% to 10% increase to EV vehicle range.1 As the Company announced on August 31, it has been awarded five programs since August 2022 taking the total number of programs awarded to 182 with six global OEMs, including Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Renault, Ferrari N.V., Jaguar Land Rover and the major German automaker program announced today.
The Company’s backlog has more than doubled since October 2022 to US$730 million3, due primarily to new program awards, with almost 50% of the backlog for EVs.
Carbon Revolution’s wheels significantly reduce unsprung mass, which greatly improves efficiency, while also helping leading global automakers to comply with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). These benefits have contributed to the award of the two previously announced OEM programs in recent months.
As the global automotive industry shifts to electric power and other sustainable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based engines. Carbon Revolution is well positioned to capture OEM demand for weight-saving efficiency technologies.
About Carbon Revolution plc
Carbon Revolution plc is the parent of Carbon Revolution Limited, an Australian technology company, which has successfully innovated, commercialized and industrialized the advanced manufacture of carbon fiber wheels for the global automotive industry. The Company has progressed from single prototypes to designing and manufacturing lightweight wheels for cars and SUVs in the high performance, premium and luxury segments, for the world’s most prestigious automotive brands. Carbon Revolution is creating a significant and sustainable advanced technology business that supplies its lightweight wheel technology to automotive manufacturers around the world.

The Electric Pickup Universe Continues To Evolve,1 month ago,Even Ford Motor (NYSE: F) didn't have it easy bringing the electric-version  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electric-pickup-universe-continues-evolve-201721586.html,"Last week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) finally delivered the highly anticipated Cybertruck four years after unveiling its prototype. But Tesla only delivered a handful of units as it is still working on streamlining the production of its futuristic electric pickup. If this year showed us anything, it is how complex it is to electrify this particular vehicle. Even Ford Motor (NYSE: F) didn’t have it easy bringing the electric-version of its bestselling pickup to life. But, automakers and automotive parts creators are not giving up. Today, Worksport (NASDAQ: WKSP)(NASDAQ: WKSPW) announced it expanded its factory production with an additional assembly line, meaning this innovative company is another step closer to bringing its solar-powered tonneau cover and portable battery system to life.
Worksport Revealed It Is Another Closer To Bringing Its Innovative Automotive Solutions To The Market
With now two assembly lines for its innovative hard-folding tonneau covers, Worksport claims it has made a significant progress on its mission of bringing innovative and sustainable automotive solutions to the world. Worksport recently announced it iniated the testing phase for its COR portable energy storage system with updates on the Alpha release due to be out soon. With the solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS, this power duo provide solar power to pickups as well as everyone else wanting freedom from the grid as the COR battery system can be used independently to provide power on the go.
Worksport set the stage for this achievement in August this year when it began production at its U.S. facility located in West Seneca, New York. The second assembly line empowers Worksport to fulfill the substantial $16 million annual sales agreement it made earlier this year. In its third quarter, Worksport posted an impressive 2,399% YoY revenue growth due to gaining a new US after-market customer.
Thanks To Its Electric Pickup, The Lightning, Ford Set A New EV Sales Record
Last Friday, Ford CEO Jim Farley revealed that F-150 Lightning sales achieved a record in November as they more than doubled. Moreover, Ford sold 4,393 units of the Lightning, therefore selling more models during November than during the entire third quarter. It even edged out Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and its R1T. Rivian was to first to bring the electric pickup to the road, but in November, Ford became the best-selling EV brand behind the EV king itself, Tesla, in the U.S. Thanks to the Lightning, as well as Mustang Mach E whose sales also rose 21.3%, Ford sold 8,958 EVs in November, which is its new EV sales record. After deciding to scale back its EV investment, it is good to see Ford post some good EV news.
Electric Pickup Competition Is Intensifying
The tech-savvy Cybertruck threatens to dim the Lightening’s and R1T's glory as the upcoming Chevy Silverado RST electric pickup. The 2024 Tesla Cybertruck claims to have a range of 470 miles, leaving behind the Rivian R1T at 410 miles and the Ford F-150 Lightning with 320-miles. Their prices vary as well. The Cybertruck’s starting price is just over $81,000 while Rivian placed the starting price of $74,800 for its R1T. The most affordable one is offered by Ford, with the starting price of the Lightning at $52,090. But considering that all of the three have a history of fluctuating prices, these figures could change. There's also the fact that Tesla CEO openly admitted that there will be challenges on the way of ramping up the production of the Cybertruck, while Ford and Rivian are accelerating their production capacities.

Tesla And Rivian Are Redefining Two Key Automotive Concepts,1 month ago,Unlike pickups from General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F)  Tesla ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-rivian-redefining-two-key-162708299.html,"While in different ways, both Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) took a shot at redefining two automotive concepts. Tesla challenged the design concept of pickups with its Cybertruck that is officially being delivered as of last Thursday, while Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) took a shot at redefining the concept automotive retail with its upcoming flagship store.
Rivian Is Opening Its Flagship Store In Historic Theater
Scheduled for December 9th, Rivian will be opening its first flagship retail location at Rivian South Coast Theater. Its first flagship store in Laguna Beach, California, is a big milestone in Rivian’s expansion strategy. Located just 15 miles from Rivian’s Irvine headquarters, it will be the largest of its retail spaces, spreading across 11,000 square feet. By choosing a historic theater, Rivian made a bold move as it blended automotive retail with its commitment to engage with communities, creating a unique experience that goes beyond traditional vehicle shopping.
Tesla Finally Brought The Cybertruck To Reality
Last Thursday, Tesla finally began delivering its much-delayed electric pickup and therefore, entered one of the most lucrative automotive segments. Unlike pickups from General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F), Tesla brought stainless steel and sharp angles to the design equation.
2023 Entered History As The Year Of Electric Pickups
Rivian is the first automaker to bring the world’s first electric pickup to the road, but Rivian R1T has now got company. The futuristic Cybertruck promises to shake things up in the pickup world. Moreover, even though pickup sales slowed down, they are still growing more than the overall automotive market. Over the first nine months of 2023, Kelley Blue Book reported that the electric version of Ford F-150, named the Lightning, experienced a rise of 40% to more than 12,000 vehicles sold, while Rivian pickups followed with a 28% increase, exceeding 14,000 electric pickups sold.
A Future Where Tesla Is Challenged Seems To Be Approaching
Despite Tesla’s price drops it introduced this year, Tesla vehicles remain expensive, which is why General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra believed the traditional automaker has a shot at overtaking the EV king in sales volume by mid-decade as GM will be offering more EV models at lower prices. Tesla still doesn’t have lower-priced models, although Elon Musk spoke about an affordable EV on several occasions. GM did commit to spend as much as $50 billion to make that happen and it is aiming to sell as many as 1 million EVs in North America by 2025, which would place it next to Tesla’s projected volume. While Tesla is hoping the Cybertruck helps it rekindle its EV spark, it seems that electric pickups will play in important role as the EV revolution goes on.

November Brought Record EV Sales And Deliveries,1 month ago,In the U.S. Ford Motor (NYSE: F) also posted its November figures on  Monday ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/november-brought-record-ev-sales-213616234.html,"On Monday, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released November sales and delivery figures. While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) China-made EVs tanked as much as 17.8% YoY, its biggest rival BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) set another record in passenger vehicle deliveries. Another China rival, XPeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) reported its sales rose as much as 245% in November. In the U.S., Ford Motor (NYSE: F) also posted its November figures on Monday, with its EV sales rising 43.2% YoY.
Tesla Reported Its China Sales Contracted In November, But It Remains On Track To Meet Its Annual Goal
Although made-in-China Model 3 and Model Y deliveries grew 14.3% from October, Tesla reported overall China sales tanked almost 18% YoY as it started delivering the revamped version of its Model 3. But Tesla is targeting a record fourth quarter as it aims to meet its 2023 goal of delivering 1.8 million vehicles. Tesla reaffirmed this goal during its latest earnings report. Considering the figures from the first three quarters of 2023, Tesla needs to deliver about 476,000 in the final quarter to make its goal, which is 2% higher than its previous record in the second quarter as well as an improvement from the third quarter’ 435,059 vehicles.
BYD Set Another Record
BYD delivered 301,378 vehicles in November. The record figure comprises of Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs along with petrol-electric hybrid models, rising 0.09% from October and 31% YoY. But despite record global EV sales, BYD growth has flattened as the automaker is making significant efforts to dethrone Tesla with its affordable EVs.
Despite Its Ups And Downs, XPeng Is Accelerating
XPeng delivered 20,041 “smart” EVs in November, which translates to a YoY growth of 245%. What’s even more impressive is that every month over the past 10 months, XPeng has been increasing sales month-over-month. This is also the second month XPeng reported sales beyond 20,000 units.
Ford Set A Record In EV Sales
Although Ford experienced a 0.5% drop in new vehicle sales in the U.S. during November, it made a record in terms of EV sales. In November, Ford sold a total of 145,559 vehicles, out of which it sold 8,958 EVs, including the electric F-150, the Lightning and Mustang Mach E. Considering that the UAW strike costed Ford $1.7 billion and that October sales also dropped 5.3%%, optimistic EV figures for November provided some much-needed good news and shares rose 1.4% during afternoon trading on Monday in response.
All in all, November brought quite a few records on the EV front, but not by the EV king itself, Tesla Inc.

One of the biggest questions facing automakers in a few years was this: ""Will new labor contracts cripple profits?"" The negotiations between United Auto Workers (UAW) and major automakers can sometimes get bitter, and with the former aggressively going after the best contracts in recent memory, it was an ominous development for auto investors.
Fortunately, we may already have an answer to the previous question, and it appears to be good news for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) investors.
Big contracts, big costs
From the start of negotiations, the UAW made it clear it was going for an ambitious contract that would aim to be the largest amount of gains in wages seen in years. That goal was fairly well accomplished, and the price tag for the new contract hit automakers like Ford and General Motors hard.
In fact, Ford anticipates the new UAW contract to cost roughly $8.8 billion -- two times the initial expectation -- over the four-and-a-half-year deal. Ford's crosstown rival, GM, predicts its deal with UAW and Canadian union Unifor will cost up to $9.3 billion.
Those are big figures when you consider Ford's updated full-year guidance calls for adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the range of $10 billion to $10.5 billion. Investors are already seeing real impact, as Ford lowered its guidance due to the new contracts from a previous range of $11 billion to $12 billion.
Let's put those figures into perhaps more understandable numbers for investors. Ford's new UAW contract will increase costs per vehicle by roughly $900. GM's number is actually lower because it employs roughly 10,000 fewer UAW members than its cross-town rival; GM expects its per-vehicle costs to increase as much as $575 on average throughout the life of the contract.
Question answered?
One of the biggest questions now facing major automakers is if they can offset these drastic cost increases. While investors should take these initial comments with a grain of salt -- we don't really expect management to fold and say they're going to go out of business -- both Ford and GM appear confident they can almost completely offset these wage increases.
GM management said it's preparing a 2024 budget that should offset much of the increases already. In fact, GM is working to cut $3 billion in fixed costs by the end of 2024.
Further, and grain of salt still in hand, it appears labor cost is less significant than it was in the past. ""Labor cost is not as significant from an overall cost perspective as it was in the past,"" Michael Ward, equity research analyst at Benchmark, told Automotive News. ""GM and Ford should be able to offset most of the increase in labor costs with other improvements.""
To be fair, if GM management is puffing out its chest to show confidence, it's at least putting its money where its mouth is. GM announced it would buy back $10 billion in shares while also increasing its dividend 33%. If management can confidently announce that right after contract negotiations, they're doing everything they can to appear at ease as they work their 2024 budget to mostly offset the new contracts.
Are the stocks a buy?
Investing in cyclical industries, especially the automotive industry, which is notoriously capital intensive, isn't for everyone. However, for value investors, or perhaps income investors, there's a compelling case for both Ford and General Motors right now. Ford and GM trade at a cheap price-to-earnings ratio of 7 and 4.7 times earnings, respectively, and have declined 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to the market's 17% gain over the past year.
On top of being cheap, Ford also offers income investors a juicy 5.4% dividend yield. While GM's yield is much lower, management's recent decision to boost the dividend 33% with a $10 billion share buyback plan shows willingness to return value to shareholders.
If management of both automakers prove they can execute and offset much of the new labor costs, this could be a great entry point into the two Detroit auto stocks before they bounce back.

12 Most Promising Car Stocks According to Analysts,3 weeks ago,Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) seems to be ahead of most companies in this ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-promising-car-stocks-095210418.html,"In this article, we discuss the 12 most promising car stocks according to analysts. To skip the detailed analysis of the automotive industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Car Stocks According to Analysts.
The car industry has been one of the most important industries in the world since Henry Ford installed the first moving assembly for the mass production of cars. It was valued at around $2.73 trillion in 2021, and the industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.01%, reaching $3.57 trillion by the end of 2031.
Electric vehicles (EV) have been one of the most prominent growth catalysts for the global automotive industry. Nevertheless, EVs have experienced a decline in sales growth in 2023. One of our previous articles reports that the electric vehicle industry experienced a surge in the average days of inventory, rising from 52 days in January to a peak of 111 days in July and going down to 97 days by October.
Several EV stocks have also taken a beating this year. The KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility ETF, which tracks companies directly involved in EV and EV component production, is down by 9.36% year-to-date (YTD) as of the December 15 market close. Some of the ETF’s biggest decliners have been Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR), Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA), and Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), which are down by 76.45%, 59.14%, and 22.69% YTD, respectively. On the other hand, the EV leader, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has gained 134.51% YTD. However, Wall Street analysts have mixed views about the company. Their average ratings and price targets show a neutral picture of the company.
Despite that, Piper Sandler believes that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be one of the top three companies that will dominate the EV market by 2030. The firm predicts that the company, along with the Chinese automaker BYD Company (BYDDF) and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), will account for 25% of all the EV sales in the US, Europe, and China.
Some of the reasons for the decline in EV sales include range anxiety and high costs among consumers and hybrid vehicles gaining more popularity in comparison. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) seems to be ahead of most companies in this hybrid trend and is planning to manufacture and sell thousands of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles in the US over the next five years.
The short-term problems faced by the EV industry are expected to fade soon. Schmidt Automotive Research previously predicted that EV sales will plateau in 2024. The firm expects a strong recovery in sales between 2025 and 2030.
Despite the decline in EV sales growth, the segment showed strength in the third quarter. The total EV sales volume jumped over 300,000 for the first time in the U.S. market and is on track to surpass 1 million sales by the end of the year. In the third quarter, the EV sales volume experienced a nearly 50% year-over-year (YoY) gain. According to the International Energy Agency, the total EV sales (including plug-in hybrid vehicles) are expected to surpass 14 million by the end of 2023, compared to 10 million in 2022.
Keeping the above information in mind, some of the most promising car stocks, according to analysts, include Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), Driven Brands Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:DRVN), and OPENLANE, Inc. (NYSE:KAR).

12. Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG)
Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.22%
Average Analyst Price Target: $261.67
Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is an American company that operates auto dealerships across the US and is one of the country’s largest auto retailers. It is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
In the third quarter, 30 hedge funds had a stake in Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG), up from 27 in the previous quarter. Abrams Capital Management held the largest stake in the company, with 2.11 million shares worth nearly $485.112 million.
On December 11, Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) completed the acquisition of one of the largest privately-owned dealership groups in the US, Jim Koons Automotive Companies. The acquisition adds 20 dealerships, 29 franchises, 6 collision centers, and one of the highest volume Toyota dealerships in the US to Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG)’s portfolio.
Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is one of the most promising car stocks according to analysts, along with Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), Driven Brands Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:DRVN), and OPENLANE, Inc. (NYSE:KAR).
In its Q3 investor letter, Black Bear Value Partners, an investment management firm, made the following comments about Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG):
“Asbury Group operates auto dealerships across the United States. While much attention is paid to the number of cars sold, the strength of the model comes from the back of the house in parts and services where more than 50% of the profits come from. We are exiting a period of high margins on new and used car sales. Shortages of inventory have allowed dealers to make record profits when selling a car. As inventories normalize and interest rates rise, I fully expect the dealers to make less profit (called the GPU) when selling a car. Car prices cannot go up ad-infinitum and at some point, there will be buyer pushback. The lower operating costs of the business are not appreciated by the market. They are appreciated by us and the management teams as most dealers, including ABG, have been buying in lots of stock with their free-cash flow.”
11. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)
Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.26%
Average Analyst Price Target: $25.63
Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based electric vehicle developer and manufacturer that produces sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, and trucks and provides related accessories, a fleet management subscription platform, and more.

Baron Funds mentioned Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:
“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc., a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer, continued their volatile trading, and after declining during the first half of 2023, rose 45.7% during the third quarter. Rivian’s unit economics are improving as a result of several factors: i) the company’s production rate is increasing, which enables it to better absorb fixed costs; ii) Rivian is ramping-up the usage of more price effective technologies, such as LFP batteries and its in-house developed motor, Enduro; and iii) the company is benefiting from renegotiated supplier agreements, as its scale and purchasing power have significantly increased over the last few years. Management expects continued progress in profitability ahead as Rivian further scales production. We remain shareholders and believe that the release of Rivian’s new smaller SUV dubbed R2, which is planned for early 2024, would enable the company to compete in the higher volume SUV segment, and significantly expand its addressable market. On the liquidity front, we expect the company to raise additional funds to support its longer-term business plans.”

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 20.56%

“AutoNation has followed an organic growth and buyback strategy versus a consolidation strategy. All of the firms have had a reduction in PE over the last 10 years. The question is: will these historical trends continue? There is a large TAM for continued consolidation, and given the PEs (6-8x earnings) today, buybacks will be accretive to all of these firms. I think the historical trends are intact and will continue into the future; thus, I am bullish on growth for the consolidation-focused automobile dealers.”

Ford (F) Trims F-150 Lightning Production Target for 2024,1 month ago,Ford Motor Company (F) : Free Stock Analysis Report · AB Volvo (VLVLY) :  Free ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-f-trims-f-150-130500081.html,"Per reports, Ford Motor Company F has reduced its planned production target of F-150 Lightning to half for 2024. In light of slowing demand, the automaker took a step back after significantly increasing its plant capacity for electric vehicles (“EVs”) this year.

Per a memo to a dealer, first reported by Automotive News, Ford plans to bring down its average weekly production volume at Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, MI, to 1,600 trucks, down from the current production volume of 3,200 per week.

During the third quarter’s earnings call, Ford’s executives shared plans to cancel or delay nearly $12 billion in EV investments due to softening demand for premium vehicles. Year-to-date, the company has lost almost $3.1 billion on EV spending and anticipates losing a total of $4 billion this year.

After receiving 200 thousand reservations for the F-150 Lightning in January 2022, Ford announced it would double its production capacity to 150 thousand units per year by mid-2023. To achieve its production target, the automaker idled its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in early 2023.

However, the demand for EVs has been slower than anticipated due to higher prices and interest rates. Year-to-date, Ford has sold a total of 20,365 trucks, up from 13,258 sold in the corresponding period of 2022. The growth in demand lags far behind the expectations of automakers, which compelled them to reduce investments in EVs.

Cathy O’Callaghan, a longtime global company leader and Ford’s vice president and controller since 2018, to assume leadership of Ford Credit in mid-February
Mark Kosman, who has played a significant role in aligning financial reporting with the Ford+ growth strategy and is streamlining Ford’s ERP, selected to be chief accounting officer
DEARBORN, Mich., December 15, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The accomplished leader of Ford’s customer-focused financial services business will retire during the first part of next year and be succeeded by a longtime company finance colleague.
Marion Harris will retire March 1 as president and CEO of Ford Credit; he’ll be replaced by Cathy O’Callaghan, Ford’s vice president, controller, and chief accounting officer since June 2018. Under Harris, Ford Credit developed and is implementing an ambitious digitization and personalization of its customer offerings, remaking itself into a true technology-based financial services company, or ""fintech.""
At the same time, Mark Kosman, presently director, Global Accounting, has been chosen to succeed O’Callaghan as Ford’s chief accounting officer.
The new roles for O’Callaghan and Kosman are effective Feb. 12, after Ford has reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results. O’Callaghan and Kosman will report to CFO John Lawler.
""Under Marion, Ford Credit was a source of strength through the global pandemic and now is remaking itself to support customers, dealers and Ford in an entirely new era of transportation and software-enabled services,"" Lawler said. ""Cathy is exceptionally well prepared to help complete that transition and grow the business, with her comprehensive global knowledge about Ford and an attention to customers that’s vital to winning over the long haul.""
Harris became the head of Ford Credit in November 2019, having previously served as the unit’s CFO and treasurer. Among other strategically important roles in his 25 years with Ford was leading market-defining capital transactions that funded Ford Credit through the Great Recession. Harris also managed the Mobility Business Group, which scaled the FordPass vehicle-control application and the business that would become Ford Pro Telematics.
""It’s really been an honor to serve this great American company for so long and to be leaving Ford Credit financially strong, with a great growth plan and a leadership team that will get it done,"" Harris said. ""We’re transforming the experience for our customers and dealers, so that Ford Credit remains a powerful reason why people choose and stay with Ford Motor Company.""
O’Callaghan brings a wealth of global financial experience to her new role. As Ford’s controller and chief accounting officer, she led a huge project to align Ford’s financial reporting with the three distinct, customer-centered business segments, which starting this year represent how the company is organized and operates: Ford Blue, for iconic gas and hybrid vehicles; Ford Model e, for breakthrough vehicles, together with advanced digital platforms and software for all of Ford’s product lines; and Ford Pro, for products and services that help commercial customers maximize their operations.
Previously, O’Callaghan was CFO of Ford South America and also held key leadership positions in Ford of Europe: finance director for Product Development, controller of European Manufacturing Operations and Logistics, finance director of Ford of Britain, and finance director of Ford Switzerland. She joined Ford in 1990.
According to Lawler, Kosman, who has been with Ford since 1989, is ideal to serve as CAO. He had a major hand in the recent financial-reporting strategic redesign and is presently leading development of Ford’s new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, to streamline accounting, procurement and supply chain operations, project management, risk management, and compliance.

Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Ford Motor fair value estimate is US$17.60
Ford Motor's US$12.34 share price signals that it might be 30% undervalued
Our fair value estimate is 30% higher than Ford Motor's analyst price target of US$13.58
Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

What's The Estimated Valuation?
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 12%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (12%– 2.2%) = US$106b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$106b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$33b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$70b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$12.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

Important Assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Next Steps:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Ford Motor, we've compiled three pertinent factors you should further examine:

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-attracting-140011115.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +20.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -74.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.1%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.86 points to a change of -1.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.8%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.77 indicates a change of -4.9% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ford Motor Company is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -12.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.91 billion and $161.04 billion estimates indicate +8% and +0.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $41.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.74%. The EPS surprise was -2.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

One thing Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) investors -- and likely investors of the broader electric vehicle (EV) industry -- know is that any complications, slowdowns, or bottlenecks in production are met with immense pessimism from Wall Street analysts.
That's what happened early in 2023 to Rivian as it faced production bottlenecks, but is this latest sign from rival Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) a warning that demand is softening? Here's why it could be a big deal.
Gone in a flash
Many headlines touted Ford's F-150 Lightning Flash, which was intended to fill a gap in price offerings for its electric truck lineup, but one thing Ford management forgot to mention was that they're significantly dialing back production of the F-150 Lightning overall.
Ford has reached out to suppliers and notified many to prepare for F-150 Lightning volume around 1,600 units a week at its Rogue Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, according to Automotive News.
To put that figure in context, remember that Ford was aiming for an annual goal of about 150,000, or about double per week what it recently told suppliers. The pullback in production was due to ""changing market demand,"" or something investors might call softening demand.
Harsh reality
It's a sudden change in strategy, considering Ford went as far as adding a third shift late in 2022 as part of its goal of hitting an annual run rate of 150,000 Lightning trucks. It wasn't a simple process either, as the plant was idled for six weeks earlier this year to enlarge the facility by more than 70%.
It's a harsh reality, but it's fairly clear: ""The narrative has taken over that EVs aren't growing; they're growing,"" CFO John Lawler said during Ford's third-quarter earnings report. ""It's just growing at a slower pace than the industry and, quite frankly, we expected.""
Ford's recent move to cut Lightning production is just one component of a broader pullback. Ford has delayed roughly $12 billion in EV investments, including a reduction of Mustang Mach-E production, and a delayed opening of one battery plant.
Is this a red flag for Rivian?
While Ford cutting its EV truck's production isn't a great sign, that doesn't confirm that Rivian is seeing the same softening demand for its truck, nor does it confirm Rivian doesn't have a backlog of R1Ts to roll off the production line.
However, there is data from Experian that suggests it could be the case. From January through September, Rivian's R1T had 8,679 registrations, down 0.7% compared to the same period in 2022. On the bright side, while the R1T registrations were flat, the company's R1S crossover had 16,439 registrations over the same time period, compared to a paltry figure of only 389 the prior year.
It's also possible that Ford management got caught up and overhyped demand and production of the Lightning too soon, because its sales are still rising. Just recently in November, Ford sold nearly 4,400 Lightning trucks, which was a monthly record. Its full-year sales through November are up 54%, compared to the prior year.
In other words, there are many possible reasons for Ford cutting production of the Lightning, and not all those reasons confirm that Rivian will face similar slowdowns at a time when investors are hoping for production to accelerate more rapidly. It is worth keeping an eye on, however, especially as Rivian is aiming to be gross profit positive next year, and a large component of that is having healthy demand matching accelerating production.

Factors such as rising demand for zero-emissions commuting and government support for low-emission vehicles through subsidies and tax breaks have resulted in automakers embracing EVs and the expansion of the electric light commercial vehicle industry. Government bodies are supporting zero emission vehicles over petrol or diesel automobiles due to growing worries about increased pollution by the automotive industry. People have acknowledged the importance of promoting zero-emission vehicles in order to prevent pollution. Government agencies in several countries are proposing attractive plans and incentives to entice and encourage individuals to acquire ELCVs, such as substantial discounts, reduction in taxes, lower road charges for zero emission vehicles, and others.
“E-Pickup Trucks is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period.”
E-pickup trucks is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period. Electric pickup trucks are generally more cost-effective to operate and maintain compared to traditional gasoline-powered pickup trucks. Their lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance requirements can lead to significant savings for businesses and consumers over time. Many governments worldwide are implementing policies to promote the adoption of electric pickup trucks, such as tax breaks, subsidies, and preferential treatment in urban areas. These incentives make electric pickup trucks more affordable and attractive to businesses and consumers. Additionally, Battery technology is continuously improving, resulting in batteries with higher energy density, enabling electric pickup trucks to travel longer distances on a single charge. OEMs such as Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Stellantis are launching new ELCVs models for instance, in May 2022, Tata Motors launches e-cargo transport solutions with the all-new Ace EV. Additionally, Tata Motors Partners with Amazon, BigBasket, Flipkart and their logistics partners for green intra-city deliveries Signs Memorandum of Understanding to deliver 39,000 Ace EVs. Also, In January 2023, the electric mobility arm of Jupiter Wagons Ltd, debuted two electric light commercial vehicles for India the Jem Tez and the EV Star CC.
“FCEV segment will grow at significant growth rate during the forecast period.”
During the forecast period, the FCEV segment is expected to grow at significant growth rate during the forecast period. FCEVs are being used for urban logistics applications, such as waste collection and last-mile delivery. This is due to their zero emissions and quiet operation, which makes them ideal for use in urban areas. Also, FCEVs are also being used for cold chain transportation applications, such as refrigerated light electric trucks and vans. This is due to their ability to operate at low temperatures and their long range. Moreover, as governments continue to support zero-emission vehicles and the e-commerce and urban logistics sectors continue to grow, FCEVs are expected to play an increasingly important role in the electric light commercial vehicle market. Manufacturers are also developing ELCVs by FCEV propulsion such as in September 2022, Hyundai and Iveco launched the Iveco daily fuel cell electric van in Hannover. With increasing interest from large multinational energy firms to transition to cleaner fuels and the strong commitment of several major OEMs such as Toyota and Hyundai, there are efforts to push the development and deployment of FCEVs. Hence the FCEV segment will grow during the forecast period.

“North America to be the fastest growing market for electric light commercial vehicle during the forecast period.”
The North American region is one of the most well-established ELCV markets in the world. Countries such as the US and Canada have a high demand for ELCVs across some of their states. Although there are not many unified regulations for the development of ELCVs, different states offer varying amounts of subsidies, tax rebates, and other incentives for ELCVs buyers and manufacturers. The region is also home to many top ELCVs manufacturers, such as General Motors, Ford and Others. These companies have worked together to cater to the ELCVs demand in the region along with other foreign players. The ELCVs market in Canada is expected to grow at a significant rate due to new regulations which are encouraging the demand for ELCVs. Top ELCVs battery providers and startups have partnered with OEMs in the North American ELCVs market. GM, for instance, has partnered with LG Chem for their ELCVs batteries. Such development will drive the growth of North America ELCVs market in the forecast period.

If you're shopping for dividend stocks during the holiday season, here are three no-brainer options: Costco (NASDAQ: COST), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG).
A special gift
Costco is a unique dividend stock, and if you were simply screening for dividend yields above a certain threshold, this stock probably wouldn't show up. However, savvy investors won't overlook the fact that Costco has a solid history of special dividends that aren't wrapped into the dividend yield figure.
In fact, Costco has done five special dividends over its history in 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2020 for $7, $5, $7, and $10, respectively. But recently the company announced an even larger special dividend, thanks to its cash-rich coffers and an upbeat quarterly earnings report. Costco announced this special dividend would deliver $15 per share on Jan. 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 28, 2023.
Costco has a solid balance sheet with only $7 billion of debt and roughly $18 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as of the fiscal first quarter. The company's strong business in the first quarter was led by growing demand for its groceries and essentials, right alongside growth in membership fees.
Costco also offers double-digit earnings growth -- up 17% year over year in the first quarter -- and it's not so much ""if"" than ""when"" Costco will deliver another large special dividend to its shareholders.
A Detroit icon
While Ford and Costco don't share many similarities in business, they do share numerous special dividends. Ford's most recent example was early in 2023 when the company was paying $0.15 quarterly for its regular dividend and declared a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, a solid boost.
The reason for the supplemental dividend was its early investment in Rivian, as the two had planned to develop a vehicle together before going their separate ways. Ford eventually sold off its stake in Rivian at a handsome profit and dished much of the cash back to shareholders.
Unlike Costco, however, Ford is trading at a cheap price-to-earnings ratio of less than 8 times, making its dividend yield a robust 5%. What's interesting about Ford when it comes to income investors and the company's dividend, is that the Ford family owns a massive chunk of Class B stock. Only Ford family members can hold these shares, and the dividend pays them over $40 million in annual income.
It's not a stretch to say the Ford family appreciates the automaker paying more attention to dividends, and that's great news if you're along for the ride.
A consumer brand juggernaut
The consumer goods company that sells brands such as Charmin, Dawn, Downy, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Pampers, and Tide, among others, is on a short list when it comes to dividends. The company has increased its annual dividend for 67 consecutive years and offers income investors a healthy 2.6% dividend yield.
What makes P&G attractive for income investors, beyond its healthy dividend, is that the company is both resilient to economic downturns and has a proven history of developing incredible brands. Further, the company can flex its brand power through price increases even during a time of inflation.
P&G's pricing contributed 7 percentage points to organic sales growth during the first quarter, while product mix only contributed 1 point and organic volume declined 1 point. That pricing power has helped boost its margins: Gross and operating margins were up 460 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively, during the first quarter.
P&G offers investors a healthy dividend, pricing and brand power, a safe haven during economic downturns, and its diluted net earnings per share jumped 17% during the first quarter. When choosing dividend stocks, P&G should make the short list.
No-brainer picks
These stocks look like no-brainers due to their luxurious special dividends, impeccable and powerful brand names, cheap trading valuations, and the fact that even during downturns they perform. Each has its own reason for being a no-brainer heading into 2024, and savvy investors would be wise to at least put them on a watch list.

Chief Executive Officer Dave Bozeman said in an interview that the recovery will be driven as replacement demand for goods picks up. Meanwhile, trucking rates will increase as capacity comes out of the market, in part due to bankruptcies like Yellow Corp.
Shippers are being cautious about restocking products after getting caught with too much of the wrong merchandise following the pandemic, Bozeman said, and the current trend toward services spending doesn’t require as much freight.
US trucking capacity hasn’t shrunk much in 2023 because carriers have a cushion from the large profits earned during 2021 and 2022 and their government stimulus payments, including the employee retention credit money that’s still flowing, he said. C.H. Robinson, which coordinates the movement of freight for customers, doesn’t own trucks.
“We’re starting to see some contraction, but we need to see a lot more.” said Bozeman, who took over as CEO at the freight brokerage in June after stints at Ford Motor Co. and Amazon.com Inc.
Freight demand also turned negative this year as trade from China softened. Spot rates in the trucking industry are down about 10% from a year ago, according to the research firm Stephens Inc., underscoring the weakness.
C.H. Robinson has responded by cutting costs and investing in technology to increase efficiency, such as large language models that can process customer emails into freight orders, Bozeman said. The company will meet its goal of increasing its shipments per employee at the North America Surface Transportation unit by 15% this year and expects to gain another 15% on this efficiency indicator in 2024, Bozeman said. Most of that will be done through attrition, he said.
“We’re moving fast and hard now in a down market to be ready for an up market,” he said.
With cargo ships avoiding the Suez Canal because of the dangers from Houthi rebels and drought causing capacity restrictions at the Panama Canal, freight is being delayed and rerouted, Bozeman said. One of the ships fired at by Houthi rebels had 28 containers that C.H. Robinson was moving for customers, and those had to be rescheduled, he said.
“Disruption is what we do,” Bozeman said. “Customers look to us to bring calm to the storm.”

Nissan (NSANY) Partners With China University to Export EVs,3 weeks ago,Per Masashi Matsuyama vice president of Nissan Motor the company is ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nissan-nsany-partners-china-university-165000044.html,"Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. NSANY plans to export electric vehicles (“EVs”) developed in China, for which it has collaborated with Tsinghua University. Per Reuters, the partnership aims to deploy local resources to speed up research and development on electrification.

Per Masashi Matsuyama, vice president of Nissan Motor, the company is contemplating an option to export the existing internal combustion engine line-up and forthcoming electric and plug-in hybrid cars developed and manufactured in China to the global market.

The automaker plans to target the same market as its China counterparts, such as BYD, he added.

Nissan is mimicking the stance of foreign brands like Tesla, BMW and Ford, who are expanding the sales of China-developed cars to benefit from the country's lower manufacturing costs and enhance the capacity utilization of their factories.

In the first 10 months of the year, Nissan sold 2.8 million vehicles in China, which is just above a fifth of Nissan's worldwide sales, down from more than a third for the corresponding period of 2022.

This year, the Japan-based automakers have faced challenges in the China market due to the soaring popularity of local automakers and fierce price competition.

Nissan announced the launch of a joint research center with Tsinghua University next year to focus on research and development of EVs, including charging infrastructure and battery recycling.

The automaker is planning to develop 10 new-energy vehicles for China. Among those vehicles, it will develop four under its brand name and the remaining with China joint venture partners. The first model with the Nissan brand is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2024.

Nissan has cooperated with Tsinghua University on joint research for intelligent mobility and autonomous driving technology since 2016. The launch of the research center is an extension of the collaborative research effort.

Better Dividend Stock: Ford or Toyota Motor Corporation?,2 weeks ago,Two dividend-paying car manufacturers that tick the quality box are Ford  Motor Company ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance ·  Crypto · Sectors...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-dividend-stock-ford-toyota-190000149.html,"If you want to diversify your portfolio, generate income, or grow your capital, dividend stocks may seem like a good option. But not all dividend stocks are worth your money.
Many of them lose value over time, especially if you spend the dividends instead of reinvesting them. That's why you need to double down on quality when selecting dividend stocks for your portfolio.
Two dividend-paying car manufacturers that tick the quality box are Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM). Both companies have strong demand for their products, robust free cash flow, and attractive dividend yields.
Which one is a better choice for dividend investors? Let's take a look under the hood to find out.
Image source: Getty Images.
The case for Ford
Ford is an iconic American auto company that's transforming its business to focus on light trucks and electric vehicles (EVs). It offers an annualized yield of 4.82%, which is almost triple that of the average stock in the S&P 500.
The automaker also has a fairly low payout ratio of 39.2%, suggesting that its dividend should be sustainable. The company has also been doling out quarterly distributions to shareholders since 1956.
However, the auto company doesn't have a consistent track record of raising its core dividend. The regular quarterly payment dropped by 50% since the final period of 2000.
Ford's share price has also declined by 51% over the past 23 years, reflecting the fierce competition for market share from foreign-car makers over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has increased by a staggering 332% over this period (not including dividends).
F Chart
Now, Ford's prospects look better than they did at the turn of the century, thanks to the company's ongoing turnaround plan and emphasis on EVs. But it faces a highly competitive industry that's constantly innovating. The EV space is also going through some growing pains at the moment, which may impact returns in the near term.
The case for Toyota
Toyota is the leading car manufacturer in Japan. It produces vehicles that are known for their high quality and dependability, which makes them more valuable than many American cars in the resale market.
Toyota's American depositary shares (ADS) offer a higher-than-average dividend yield of 2.23%, and the company has an exceptionally low payout ratio of 22.1%. Its dividend thus screens as safe based on this metric. Toyota distributes dividends twice a year to shareholders.
The automaker has a history of increasing its dividend over time (see chart below), and management has recently stated that growing the dividend is a priority. Another advantage that Toyota has over some of its U.S. rivals is that it has lower costs for pension and retiree healthcare.
Its ADS have also generated gains of 130% over the prior 23 years, which far exceeds Ford's return on capital over this period. The only downside with this Japanese carmaker is that it's lagging in the EV market.
TM Dividends Paid (TTM) Chart
Verdict
Putting aside the possible tax implications of holding ADS, Toyota seems to be the better choice in this comparison. While Ford may have a slight edge in the EV market, Toyota is a well-known innovator with enormous financial resources.
It also has a much better history of increasing its dividend over time and generating positive returns for shareholders. Ford may change the situation in the future, but for now, Toyota has the upper hand.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024.
An Analysis of the Global Automotive Industry
According to a report published by Fortune Business Insights, the global automotive industry was valued at $2.74 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.01% up till 2031, reaching $3.57 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.
The United States of America is one of the top players in the automotive industry and contributes approximately 3% to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. According to a report published by Mordor Intelligence, the North American automobile industry was sized at $940 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $1.22 trillion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 5.43% over the projected period. Rising demand for high-end transport vehicles, emergence and rapid adoption of electric vehicles, increased investments in infrastructure, and rising per capita income of the population are the key factors driving growth in the automotive industry.
The automotive industry is one of the biggest industries in the world. According to a report by IBISWorld, global car and automobile sales generated a staggering $4.3 trillion in annual revenue in 2023 alone. The industry comprises various smaller markets including automotive manufacturing, auto parts, and dealerships. Light commercial vehicles, also known as passenger vehicles, are one of the biggest segments of the automotive industry. Other segments include sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs, and luxury trucks. 
According to the report, light commercial vehicles held the largest market share in 2022. The growing share of passenger vehicles in the industry is mainly due to the inclination of manufacturers towards incorporating high-end technologies such as advanced navigation systems and autonomous driving technologies that uplift the user experience. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Paccar Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) have taken the lead as they stay committed to introducing next-generation vehicles that feature cutting-edge technologies and premium quality interiors.
The electric vehicle industry is poised for growth as well, with companies including Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO), and Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) leading the market. On December 1, Reuters reported that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) launched the long-awaited Cybertruck starting at $60,990, which is 50% more expensive than the anticipated price following CEO Elon Musk's statement in 2019. However, Elon Musk is confident that the truck will attract affluent buyers and said that the “Cybertruck has more utility than a truck and is faster than a sports car”.
Wall Street analysts are positive on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). On December 27, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his price target of $380 on the stock and kept an overweight opinion. As of December 27, the stock has surged over 137% on a year-to-date basis.
Furthermore, with the Paris Agreement in place, other key players in the industry have started to diversify their production with electric vehicles. For instance, on November 30, Reuters reported that the Chief Financial Officer of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in a recent conference said that the automakers will witness improvements in electric vehicle margins as it is expected to reach a mid-single-digit profit before interest and tax margin targets by 2025.
On October 24, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) reported solid earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $2.28 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.44. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $44.13 billion, up 5.35% year over year and ahead of market consensus by $879.02 million.
Restraining Factors and The Way Forward
Moving forward, the automotive industry may face challenges such as the high cost of manufacturing and data management. The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as advanced driver assistance systems and other software-backed technologies can increase the overall cost of production.
However, the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) segment of the industry still holds the largest market share as per the aforementioned reports. The US has a vast network of diesel and gasoline stations that makes it convenient for customers to fuel vehicles and the lower upfront cost is expected to propel further growth in the segment. Furthermore, the BEV sector will help ease the restraining factors as supportive government policies for minimizing pollution levels fuel the growth of the electric vehicle market. On December 5, Bloomberg reported that Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will take a direct stake in nickel plant construction for batteries in Indonesia along with Indonesian and Chinese investors. It will not only help Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) secure material for electric vehicles but will also strengthen its oversight in mining and refining of the material.
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was a part of 43 investors' portfolios at the close of the third quarter of 2023. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $1.33 billion, up from $895.5 million in the preceding quarter when 40 hedge funds held positions in the group.
For the competitive automotive industry, investors should keep an eye on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Let's now take a look at the 25 most in-demand cars heading into 2024.

To collect data for the most in-demand cars heading into 2024 we consulted 4 sources including Kelly Blue Book, Car and Driver, U.S. News & World Report, and Edmunds. A consensus approach was employed to assimilate our list in which we tracked the number of times a car was mentioned in our sources and its rank in each source. We shortlisted 30 cars that appeared in at least 2 of the 4 sources. Then we computed the average rank of each car by summing their individual ranks and dividing it by the number of times it appeared in a source. The list is ranked in descending order of the computed average rankings.

Stratasys (SSYS) Gets Unsolicited Proposal From Nano ...,2 weeks ago,Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) : Free Stock Analysis Report · Stratasys Ltd  ... Yahoo Finance. Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and  reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stratasys-ssys-gets-unsolicited-proposal-140200682.html,"Stratasys SSYS confirmed that it has received an unsolicited takeover offer from Nano Dimension NNDM. The proposed offer price is $16.50 per share in cash, representing a 40% premium from the volume-weighted average Stratasys share price since Sep 28, 2023.

Stratasys had previously announced the initiation of a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, on Sep 28, 2023.

Nano Dimension is the largest single shareholder of Stratasys with a current liquidity profile that includes more than $800 million of net cash. In July 2022, NNDM acquired 12.12% of SSYS’ outstanding shares and through the latest deal, it intends to buy the remaining stake of the Eden Prairie, MN-headquartered firm.

In March, Nano Dimension made an unsolicited, non-binding indicative proposal to acquire Stratasys for $18 per share in cash.

NNDM has not been approached by Stratasys or its representatives during the strategic alternatives assessment. The company has proactively submitted the acquisition proposal and expressed its willingness to enter customary transaction-related documentation for confirmatory due diligence immediately.

Nano Dimension anticipates that only a short due diligence period will be required by the board of NNDM, given its deep understanding of Stratasys and the additive manufacturing (AM) industry.

The buyout will likely strengthen Nano Dimension’s 3D printing business, creating a market leader with an unparalleled portfolio of materials, software and deep learning with a go-to-market strength in the form of sales channels. Moreover, the acquisition would give the manufacturing company access to Stratasys’ wide range of premium polymer-based 3D printing systems, material and consumables, fused deposition modeling and PolyJet AM machines portfolio, which would help it fortify its manufacturing capabilities and overall productivity.

NNDM plans to finance the proposed acquisition with available cash on hand. Additionally, the company is in discussions with financing sources to provide support if needed and there is no financing contingency to the proposal.

The proposal is subject to the completion of a satisfactory confirmatory due diligence process and the negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive acquisition agreement. However, there is no guarantee that the acquisition will be completed.

What Makes Stratasys a Takeover Target?
Stratasys has been scaling newer heights across all its business segments. It has been benefiting from an increase in demand for 3D-printed materials and its focus on product launches and strategic partnership agreements or acquisitions.

Over the past few quarters, the company has inked strategic partnerships with the likes of Schneider Electric, The Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co., Siemens SIEGY, Boom Supersonic and Toyota TM to fuel its growth momentum. Such collaborations help introduce advanced 3D printing technologies to the aerospace and automotive industries while expanding Stratasys’ geographic reach and driving its market penetration. These partnerships spell opportunities for the company’s 3D systems business while increasing its installed base.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s 2023 earnings is pegged at 15 cents per share, indicating flat year-over-year growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Stratasys recently collaborated with Siemens Healthineers for a groundbreaking research initiative aimed at creating innovative solutions to advance medical imaging phantoms for computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT phantoms, which are crucial tools in medical imaging and widely utilized in hospitals globally, are specialized devices employed to assess and verify the performance of CT scanners.

SSYS has entered into an agreement with Toyota to become the inaugural customer to acquire the state-of-the-art Stratasys F3300 3D printer. Toyota intends to employ the F3300 for various purposes, including new production support for parts and fixtures, as well as prototyping applications to expedite the introduction of new products to the market. The F3300 possesses the capability to produce intricate, high-precision parts vital to vehicle design and usage, spanning from prototypes to end-use components.

No Tesla's Big Recall Isn't a Big Deal for the Stock,2 weeks ago,Daniel Miller has positions in Ford Motor Company. The Motley Fool has ...  Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-teslas-big-recall-isnt-120200645.html,"Earlier this month, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) recalled more than 2 million electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. market. It was the largest recall in the young company's history, covering nearly all Tesla vehicles on U.S. roads. Based on a glance at the headlines, you couldn't be blamed for thinking it will be a massive ordeal for the company. But it might not be as big a deal as some investors think.
What's the problem?
This recall covers the Model S from the 2012 to 2023 model years, the Model X from 2016 to 2023, the Model 3 from 2017 to 2023, and the Model Y from 2020 to 2023. Those EVs are equipped with Autosteer -- a beta feature that detects lane markings, vehicles, and other objects to help the driver steer in some situations.
While Tesla didn't necessarily agree with the conclusions of the recall report, the EV maker did announce it would release an over-the-air software update to add more controls and alerts to encourage drivers to remain engaged in driving.
So how big of a deal is this for investors? There are a few things to consider.
By the numbers
While this recall is large, and Tesla also recently recalled 120,000 vehicles to fix an issue that could cause their doors to unlock during a crash, such events are a common feature of the automotive industry. In fact, just a week later, Honda recalled over 2.5 million vehicles for a fuel pump issue, and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), albeit with full-year data incomplete, looks likely to lead the industry in total recall volume for the third consecutive year.
Generally speaking, major automakers have long planned for warranty and recall situations, and often have reserve funds set aside for these developments. It's rare for a recall to impact financials enough to derail even a single quarter's earnings, although it can happen.
Further, as a rule of thumb for investors, hardware recalls that require vehicles to be brought to a dealership are much more expensive than software recalls that can be implemented via an over-the-air update. Because Tesla's large recall will be accomplished with over-the-air software adjustments, at least for now, its direct financial impact on the company will be fairly minimal. It's also worth noting that European regulators did not issue a recall order over the Autosteer concerns. The EU has different rules and standards about what driver-assist functions are allowable.
More to the story?
While the large recall is likely to have minimal direct impact on the company, investors should keep an eye open for indirect impacts. For instance, the recalls could threaten to undermine the company's defense in multiple high-profile lawsuits it faces due to crashes linked to Tesla's Autopilot.
Roughly half a dozen lawsuits are headed to trial over the next year in Florida, California, and Texas. Lawyers are sure to claim these recalls, although voluntary by Tesla, support their assertions that the Autopilot system is defective and contributed to multiple collisions, some of which resulted in fatalities.
Thus far, Tesla has prevailed in such suits using the defense that its owner's manuals and the company's online information state clearly that active driver engagement and supervision are still required when using those features. California courts sided with Tesla in trials for two separate crashes in which plaintiffs blamed Autopilot for steering vehicles off the road.
Not a big deal?
For investors who have a clearly defined thesis on whether Tesla is a quality investment or not, these headline-making recalls shouldn't alter their views. Their direct impacts and costs will be minimal, and their indirect impacts could also be minimal if they don't undermine Tesla's defenses in court cases.
Recalls and crashes are an unpleasant part of the automotive industry, but savvy investors would be wise to focus their attention on other developments such as the potential weakening of EV demand. At the end of the day, Tesla updating the software on 2 million vehicles won't be a big deal for the stock or your investment thesis.

Tesla deliveries to hit record but fall short of Musk's aspirations,2 weeks ago,... company has lost market share to locals including BYD. The price war  and ... Yahoo Finance. Citigroup discloses billions in one-time charges and  reserves...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-deliveries-hit-record-fall-110512624.html,"By Akash Sriram and Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla is expected to post another record quarter for electric vehicle (EV) deliveries, likely shy of an ambitious 2 million annual internal target that CEO Elon Musk touted at the beginning of the year.
Faced with slowing sales, Tesla leveraged its industry-leading margins and slashed prices of its four car models globally in 2023, with a focus on China, where the company has lost market share to locals including BYD.
The price war and slowing EV demand, however, have prompted automakers including Ford Motor to pull back on their electrification plans, leaving Tesla as the undisputed leader in the United States and helping its stock more than double this year.
""The fourth quarter is typically the strongest of the year in terms of deliveries for Tesla, we're expecting that to be the case again this year,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior analyst at CFRA Research.
Tesla likely delivered 1.82 million vehicles globally in 2023, up 37% from 2022, with about 473,000 units in the fourth quarter, according to 14 analysts polled by LSEG. The EV maker is expected to report quarterly deliveries and production as early as Tuesday.
In January, Musk said that Tesla has the potential to achieve 2 million deliveries this year, if there was no ""freaking force majeure"". But as recently as October, he warned that higher borrowing costs were pressuring demand.
The company, which made a year-end sales push by increasing discounts on its key models, has said it aims to achieve a 50% average annual growth rate over multiple years.
Going into 2024, the EV market leader will have to contend with the loss of federal tax credits for some of its cars in the United States as well as in Germany, where the government is prematurely ending its EV subsidy program.
This may force more price cuts next year even though interest rates and battery ingredient costs are expected to ease.
Jairam Nathan, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, trimmed his estimate for Tesla's deliveries next year to 2.04 million from 2.14 million and said he was modeling for a 4% decline in average revenue per car from 2023.
2024 CHALLENGES
The company is also dealing with a rise in regulatory scrutiny of its self-driving systems and other parts in the United States and in some European countries. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled nearly all of its 2 million vehicles on U.S. roads to install new safeguards.
Musk has previously said he believes full self-driving (FSD) could one day account for most of Tesla's value.
Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect 2.2 million deliveries by Tesla next year. Most believe that the newly released Cybertruck and a refreshed Model 3 are not enough to boost demand.
""Tesla candidly admitted the company is now in an intermediate low-growth period,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note, citing a meeting with Investor Relations Chief Martin Viecha.
Investors expect Tesla's margins to remain pressured as the company ramps Cybertruck production and prepares to launch a cheaper car platform.
Musk has said Cybertrucks will be a small percentage of the vehicles Tesla makes next year and that there are ""enormous challenges"" in reaching volume production for the pickup, whose controversial design has divided fans.
Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a report that Cybertruck would represent 3% of Tesla's volumes in 2024, calling it more of a ""halo"" product that could attract consumers to the brand.

Fisker (FSR) Commences Deliveries of Ocean Sports in U.K.,2 weeks ago,Fisker FSR began the deliveries of its Ocean Sport electric sport utility  vehicle (SUV) marking a new milestone for the company. ... Yahoo Finance  Plus...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fisker-fsr-commences-deliveries-ocean-124600715.html,"Fisker FSR began the deliveries of its Ocean Sport electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), marking a new milestone for the company. The automaker handed over its first unit to a customer at the Fisker Lounge London, located in the Westfield London mall.

Per Henrik Fisker, chairman and CEO of Fisker, the Fisker Ocean Sport is an affordable vehicle comprising design, innovation and sustainability, which are the company’s core brand values.

The Ocean Sport has a 73 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery, along with a front-mounted motor developing 275 hp, which enables it to accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour (mph) in seven seconds. It is rated at 288 miles in the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) cycle.

In the United States, Ocean Sport has a starting price of $38,999, much less than the prices of the all-wheel drive Ocean Ultra and the Ocean Extreme.

The vehicle features a 17.1-inch touchscreen, 20-inch F7 AeroStealth wheels, a digital rearview mirror, automatic emergency braking, a Fisker Intelligent Pilot driver assistance system, a panoramic glass roof and a power liftgate.

It operates in two modes, namely, Fun mode and Earth mode. The Fun mode supports spirited driving, while the Earth mode offers maximum efficiency.

As a crossover SUV, Ocean Sport has an edge over its popular counterparts, the Tesla Model Y and the Ford Mustang Mach-E, due to its affordable pricing.

Cox Automotive Forecast: U.S. Auto Sales Expected to Finish ...,2 weeks ago,Large year-over-year gains in 2023 have been delivered by Honda Nissan  General Motors and Tesla. The Hyundai Motor Group with Genesis Hyundai  and Kia...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cox-automotive-forecast-u-auto-160000186.html,"Cox Automotive forecasts full-year 2023 U.S. auto sales to finish near 15.5 million units, up from 13.9 million in 2022 and down from the market peak of 17.5 million in 2016.
Cox Automotive forecasts annual vehicle sales pace in December to be near 15.1 million, up 1.6 million from last December's 13.5 million pace but down from November's 15.3 million level.
December's sales volume is expected to rise 6.2% from one year ago and reach 1.36 million units. Volume this month will increase by 10.4% from November, which had two less selling days.
ATLANTA, Dec. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- December new-vehicle sales, announced next week, are expected to show gains over last year's product-constrained market. According to the Cox Automotive forecast released today, sales volume this month is expected to rise 6.2% over December 2022. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), or sales pace, is expected to finish near 15.1 million in December. This SAAR is 1.6 million higher compared to last year's pace. However, it reflects a slight decline from last month's 15.3 million level and matches the lowest SAAR of the year, which was recorded in May.
Cox Automotive (PRNewsfoto/Cox Automotive)
According to Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive: ""December is generally a strong month for new-vehicle sales as holiday shoppers look for year-end deals, and this year will be no exception. With supply much higher now and incentives higher as well, this December is expected to finish significantly better than last year. But high vehicle prices and high interest rates remain the industry's Grinch right now, and that trend will continue into next year.""
2023: A Surprisingly Strong Sales Year
New-vehicle sales have been stronger and more consistent than expected throughout 2023. The new-vehicle market has been supported by growing deliveries, improving supply levels and higher incentives. Full-year 2023 U.S. auto sales, based on vehicle counts by Kelley Blue Book, are forecast to finish near 15.5 million units, an increase of 11.6% from 13.9 million in 2022 and ahead of Cox Automotive's forecast from one year ago.
Large year-over-year gains in 2023 have been delivered by Honda, Nissan, General Motors and Tesla. The Hyundai Motor Group, with Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia brands, had a strong year in the U.S. market, growing sales by more than 12% and passing Stellantis – maker of Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Chrysler and other brands – to take the fourth spot in overall U.S. sales, behind Ford. Of all major automakers, Stellantis is the only one expected to post lower year-over-year sales, as the company pursues a strategy of lower volume and higher revenue per sales.
Higher New-Vehicle Inventory Levels and Strong Fleet Activity Support Improved Sales Pace
New-vehicle inventory volume was 2.56 million at the start of December, higher by more than 900,000 units from one year ago. Meanwhile, days' supply had climbed to 71, up from 60 at the start of November and more than 17 days higher than December 2022. At the beginning of December, new-vehicle days' supply is closer to the pre-pandemic norm than in the last several years.
Fleet sales are expected to rise in December after experiencing two months of pull-back in commercial and rental vehicle sales. The lower fleet volume was particularly affected by big drops in fleet sales from the Detroit Three due to the UAW strike.
Chesbrough notes: ""With the strike now in the rearview mirror, December is expected to show a return to stronger fleet activity, and these sales could have a big impact on the month's final tally.""

SEC ends crypto drama by giving the  green light to 11...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-attracting-140010584.html,"Ford Motor Company (F) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +14.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -74.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.86 points to a change of -1.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.77 indicates a change of -4.9% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ford Motor Company is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -12.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $160.91 billion and $161.04 billion estimates indicate +8% and +0.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Ford Motor Company reported revenues of $41.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.74%. The EPS surprise was -2.5%.
Over the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Ford Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Ford Just Lost Billions of Dollars on EVs. Here's Why That's ...,5 days ago,Daniel Miller has positions in Ford Motor Company and General Motors. The  ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors ·  Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-just-lost-billions-dollars-130200187.html,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) just released its fourth-quarter sales data for investors to chew on before the company releases its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results later this month. The good news is that the company posted a record quarter for electric vehicle (EV) sales, but the bad news is that means billions of losses in the near term.
Here's why it's still a positive development for Ford investors.
Devil in the details
Ford's 2023 U.S. sales jumped 7.1% to nearly 2 million vehicles, led by strength in its F-Series full-size trucks, commercial vehicles, and a record year with electric vehicles.
Let's start with the company's most important product, the truck that hauls profits for the folks at the Blue Oval. Ford's F-Series was America's best-selling truck for the 47th consecutive year and the best-selling vehicle for the 42nd consecutive year. In fairness, it's a title Ford will likely continue to hold, as its prime competitor, General Motors, arguably splits some of its sales between two brands of trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra.
What's encouraging for investors is that the F-150 Lightning was the No. 1-selling electric truck and the F-150 Hybrid the No. 1-selling full-size hybrid truck for the full year. It's important for investors to see that Ford's strength in full-size gasoline-powered trucks can transition to EVs, because full-size trucks are a critical component for a fatter bottom line.
Speaking of EVs...
That's a nice transition to another critical component of Ford's fourth-quarter and full-year sales: electric vehicles. Ford's EVs posted record fourth-quarter sales to drive a record full year. More specifically, the Detroit icon sold nearly 26,000 EVs during the fourth quarter, up 24% compared to the third quarter, to help drive an 18% gain for the full year.
Much of Ford's EV sales gain was driven by the previously mentioned F-150 Lightning, which recorded a 74% sales increase compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, and a 55% increase for the full year. Between the F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, and the E-Transit, Ford secured America's No. 2 EV brand for 2023.
The bad news
Here's the kicker about Ford's record EV sales: The company is still burning cash on each EV that rolls off its production line. In fact, Ford previously estimated its EV business unit, Model e, would lose roughly $4.5 billion in 2023.
Management believes Ford will bring costs down enough and accelerate production to churn profits from its Model e unit by the end of 2026, but for now a record quarter in EV sales also means a less lucrative full-year earnings result.
But as they say, the night is darkest just before dawn. Ford has to achieve these quarterly records for EV sales in order to reduce overhead and costs eventually and reach profitability. Essentially, quarterly record EV sales means short-term pain for long-term gains.
On Ford's presentation for its pathway to 8% EBIT margins by the end of 2026, the biggest chunk of margin gains will come from scaling production/sales, with the rest coming from a combination of design and engineering, as well as lower battery costs.
Data source: Ford Motor Company presentation.
What's next?
Ford closed the 2023 chapter with a little sales momentum, but management believes the company is still poised for growth in 2024, driven by its strength in full-size trucks and SUVs. In fact, Ford will unleash new F-150s, Rangers, Explorers, and Expeditions, as well as Lincoln Aviators, Navigators, and Nautilus.
Most importantly, even though headlines will tout Ford's large losses with EVs currently, Ford needs to keep posting record EV sales to reach profitability sooner rather than later.

Ford Motor Co. announced price changes for its line of 2024 model Ford F-150 Lightning all-electric pick-up trucks. The entry-level model of the F-150 Lightning Pro will now start at $54,995, up from $49,995 for 2023 models. However, the U.S.-based auto manufacturer is cutting the price for the high-end F-150 Lightning with a Platinum Black trim package. That vehicle will now cost $92,995, down from $97,995.

The Platinum model, similarly, received a price cut of $5,000.
CNBC reported the price adjustments are designed to “balance slower-than-expected consumer demand with profits. Ford is also reducing planned production of the F-150 Lightning by roughly half.
“We are making adjustments to pricing, production and trim packages to achieve the optimal mix of sales growth, profitability and customer access to the IRA tax benefit,” a Ford spokesperson told CNBC.

Changes to the F-150 Lighting Line
The entry-level model F-150 Lightning Pro qualifies for the full $7,500 tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, based on its list price and other criteria. The 2024 XLT 311 A — now $64,995 compared to $54,995 for the 2023 model — also qualifies, as does the Lariat, which increased in price from $77,495 up to $79,495, according to the Detroit Free Press.
However, the Platinum and Platinum Black models will not qualify, as their MSRP still exceeds the $80,000 limit set by the IRS. Ford also eliminated the XLT 312 A model and the lower-range Lariat for 2024. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Detroit Free Press that the company was focusing on building fewer models in an effort to reduce costs and improve quality.
Ford also added one new truck to the line for 2024. The mid-range Flash has an estimate range of 320 miles per charge and lists for $73,495, making it eligible for the tax credit.
The new pricing, as listed, does not include the mandatory $2,095 destination fee, taxes, or registration. It also does not reflect any federal or local tax credits or other incentives associated with purchasing an EV.
Ford F-150 Lightning vs. Tesla Cybertruck: Which Costs Less?
Tesla recently announced pricing for the long-awaited Cybertruck, which will be available in 2025. The starting price for the rear-wheel drive, single-motor entry level model is $61,240 before delivery, destination charges, taxes and incentives, according to Edmunds. This vehicle should also qualify for the full IRA tax credit.
The All-Wheel drive model and the Cyberbeast, retailing for $80,240 and $100,240, respectively, are available for delivery now.
Although the price for the entry-level model is higher than Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised in 2019, when the futuristic vehicle was unveiled for the first time, the base model is comparable to Ford’s 2024 XLT 311 A F-150  Lightning.
The higher-end Cybertruck models (available now) compare to Ford’s Platinum and Platinum Black trim packages, with the F-150 Platinum coming in higher than the AWD Cybertruck, and the high-end trim package more than $7,000 cheaper than the Cyberbeast.
How Much Will You Really Pay for These EVs?
Given that Ford EVs are sold through local dealers, who may still be open to haggling and may offer their own incentives to encourage sales, you might find a better deal on an F-150 Lightning compared to a Cybertruck.
Of course, how much you pay for any of these vehicles will also vary widely based on your financing costs. Tesla drivers have previously noted that they’ve received financing as low as 3.24%, albeit these rates were reported in 2022 and not for the Cybertruck.
Currently, Ford is not offering any incentives for financing an F-150 Lightning truck, and, in late 2023, CarEdge.com reported that the F-150 Lightning is excluded from promotional financing deals, although that may change as new vehicles roll onto lots. Currently, the Ford website is only showing 2023 F-150 Lightning models.

3 Stocks to Buy While They Are On Sale,1 week ago,The stock of Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) appears to be attractively valued  at recent levels. Investors have very different opinions about it though.  Bulls...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-while-sale-143000403.html,"Market downturns can be appealing to those who have been accumulating cash and are eager to pounce on some bargains. That's because such times present great opportunities when the stocks of lots of solid companies with great growth prospects have fallen into bargain territory.
You don't need a market downturn to find some great opportunities, though. Even when the market has been rising for a while and is frothy, there will be some bargains for those who can find them. These days the market has been clawing its way back from a downturn, and plenty of good companies are still selling at attractive stock prices. Here are three to consider.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Ford Motor Company
The stock of Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) appears to be attractively valued at recent levels. Investors have very different opinions about it, though. Bulls like that the company has been investing heavily in electric vehicles (EVs), which are growing in popularity. But Ford is not yet taking the EV world by storm. In fact, it has cut back its immediate production goals for its electric F-150 truck.
Its third quarter featured the company continuing to be the U.S.'s top truck seller, with sales of its Bronco SUVs up 25% year over year. Sales of hybrid and electric vehicles hit new records, and sales of vans were up by double digits, too. On the other hand, it has not been a great revenue grower in recent years, and its profit margins have been thin.
If you're bullish on Ford and think it will turn its situation around, take a closer look at it. Its dividend, recently yielding 5.8%, is quite attractive. Ford may not soar over the coming year, but it's likely to keep growing over many years, rewarding its shareholders with significant income and likely stock price appreciation, as well. If you're not sure, maybe add it to a watchlist.
2. Walt Disney
Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) is also a dividend payer, but its yield is currently below 1%. In fact, it suspended its payout in 2020 and has only just reinstated it, at 34% of what it last was. Dividends from healthy and growing companies tend to be increased, though, so those who buy now should enjoy effectively higher yields in the future.
Disney's stock has recently been trading more than 50% below its high three years ago and near a nine-year low, making its valuation appealing. Its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16 is well below its five-year average of 41, and there's a lot to like about its multifaceted businesses, too.
CEO Bob Iger has been cutting costs successfully and sees a period of repair giving way to one of building. Its streaming businesses, such as Disney+ and Hulu (which it will soon own all of), hold much promise for further growth, and it's planning an ESPN streaming service, as well (Disney owns 80% of ESPN). Disney is also planning to plow $60 billion into its theme parks over the coming decade.
The company has been around for a full century, and it's built to last for many more decades, at least.
3. Veeva Systems
Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) is not a dividend payer because it's still investing heavily in its growth. The company offers a cloud-based platform for the life sciences industry -- for example, helping biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies manage clinical trials of treatments in development, among other things.
Veeva's third quarter was solid, featuring revenue of $617 million, up 12% year over year, while net income jumped 25%. CEO Peter Gassner noted: ""We announced a number of new innovations, expanded in existing markets, and continued progress in newer areas like Vault CRM, positioning us well for durable, profitable growth for years to come.""
Veeva's stock is appealingly priced at recent levels, with a forward P/E ratio near 44, well below the five-year average of 67. It has a price-to-sales ratio of 13, down sharply from its five-year average of 23. Note, though, that those are all fairly steep numbers. So if you're risk averse, you might hold off, hoping for a lower entry point -- though with fast growers like Veeva, such lower entry points often never come. It helps to be a long-term investor, aiming to hold your shares for many years.
These are just three of many attractively priced companies you might consider for berths in your portfolio. Dig a little deeper into any that interest you to see if they seem like a good fit for you.

As GM's Cruise Headaches Continue Maybe Ford Was Right ...,1 week ago,Though Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) are  bitter ... Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto ·  Sectors · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gms-cruise-headaches-continue-maybe-112000065.html,"Though Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) are bitter rivals, especially in their bread-and-butter full-size truck segment, the truth is they have much more in common than not. In fact, it's a rare divergence when the two don't have a similar strategy when it comes to the automotive industry.
But that rare divergence happened when Ford severely scaled back its homegrown driverless vehicle ambitions (and took a big $2.7 billion charge on Argo AI) while General Motors appeared to double down on its Cruise driverless vehicle.
Given the recent Cruise headaches, was Ford right all along? And more importantly, what does it mean for Ford's investors?
GM's Cruise takes a hit
Cruise was the first company to start commercial driverless rides in San Francisco in the summer of 2022, and problems surfaced almost immediately. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a probe on two incidents when Cruise vehicles hit pedestrians and other incidents when Cruise vehicles interfered with emergency responders. Then the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise's permits for driverless testing and deployment, calling them ""unsafe."" Amid the onslaught of negative publicity, Kyle Vogt, who co-founded Cruise in 2013, resigned as CEO in November 2023.
Let's not forget that right as California suspended Cruise's permits, the company was planning an ambitious expansion. It had launched smaller-scale operations in Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas, with preparations for a dozen more locations and even rumors of entering Tokyo.
Cruise slashed almost 25% of its full-time workforce and fired nine executives in the middle of December. After a complete leadership overhaul, it was fair for investors to question not only the future of Cruise but whether or not rival Ford had been right all along.
Was Ford giving up or being smart?
Let's rewind to the end of 2022, when Ford bucked the unmistakable buzz surrounding General Motors' Cruise ambitions, and gave up on developing its own fully autonomous driving technology with Argo AI -- a move that cost the company $2.7 billion in impairment charges.
At the time, Ford simply admitted to investors that bringing level 4 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to the market profitably wasn't feasible anytime soon. Management remained confident there was indeed a future for the technology, just that Ford didn't need to spend significant resources to create that technology.
Ford decided to refocus its efforts on level 2 and level 3 systems, which don't completely cut out the human driver, to better provide customers with premium services and offer investors better profitability.
What did investors learn?
In fairness, General Motors has been doing a lot of things right over the past 15 years, since the 2008-09 Great Recession and financial crisis brought the company to its knees. But when bitter rivals that generally focus on similar strategies choose opposite paths on such a big development, investors should be asking a lot more questions. As I noted back in 2022, Ford's move to scale back its driverless car efforts should be a warning sign for General Motors.
So far, General Motors is saying the right things for long-term investors. The company is refocusing Cruise on safety, and it reassured investors it has the capital to continue funding Cruise, which has lost more than $8 billion since 2016. GM even boasted a bit, claiming not only to back Cruise's turnaround efforts but also to increase its dividend by 33%. It also announced a $10 billion share buyback program.
For investors, keeping an eye on Cruise will be an important component of any investing thesis. It could be one reason GM makes investors rich over the next two decades, or it could be a profitable black hole for a decade, leaving investors wondering why GM didn't follow Ford's lead here.
Stay tuned. It's sure to be an interesting ride.

Is Rivian Automotive Stock a Buy Now?,6 days ago,... Ford Motor Company and the bulls were aggressively bidding growth and  meme stocks to astronomical valuations. At its all-time high of $172.01 on  Nov. 16...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-stock-buy-now-104200817.html,"Rivian Automotive's (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock price dropped 10% on Jan. 2 after the electric vehicle maker posted its latest production numbers. For the fourth quarter of 2023, it produced 17,541 vehicles and delivered 13,972 vehicles.
For the full year, it produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122 vehicles. That surpassed its latest full-year production target of 54,000 vehicles, but investors won't know the other finer details until it posts its full earnings report on Feb. 21.
Image source: Rivian.
Rivian's production numbers seem stable, but its fourth-quarter deliveries narrowly missed the consensus forecast for 14,111 deliveries. Its full-year production also came in below its own rumored target of 62,000 vehicles, which it claims was taken out of context and leaked from an internal meeting. So should investors still buy Rivian's stock -- which remains more than 70% below its initial public offering (IPO) price -- as the bulls look the other way?
Why did the bulls rush for the exits?
Rivian currently produces three types of EVs: the R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV, and an electric delivery van (EDV) for its top investor, Amazon. It's committed to delivering 100,000 EDVs to Amazon by the end of the decade.
Rivian gained a lot of attention when it went public in November 2021 because it was already ramping up its production, it was backed by Amazon and Ford Motor Company, and the bulls were aggressively bidding growth and meme stocks to astronomical valuations. At its all-time high of $172.01 on Nov. 16, 2021, Rivian's enterprise value reached $151 billion -- a whopping 91 times the revenue it would actually generate in 2022.
Those bubbly valuations set Rivian up for a steep drop when it started missing its own production targets. In 2021, it produced 1,015 vehicles. In 2022, it produced 24,337 vehicles, but that was less than half of its original goal of 50,000 vehicles. It blamed that slowdown on supply chain constraints across the EV market, but the bulls lost patience in Rivian as rising interest rates compressed its valuations and cast a harsh light on its steep losses.
At the end of 2022, Rivian set a goal of producing 50,000 vehicles in 2023 -- and it gradually raised that target to 54,000 throughout the year. Its near-term outlook brightened as the supply chain situation improved and it ramped up the production of its in-house Enduro drive unit to curb its dependence on third-party components.
Unfortunately, a series of safety-related recalls, debt offerings, and layoffs indicated Rivian was still struggling to maintain a sustainable business model. That's why Ford had liquidated most of its stake in Rivian by early 2023, and why the bulls still haven't been eager to rush back to its beaten-down stock in this volatile market.
Can Rivian expand without breaking the bank?
For 2023, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to rise 165% to $4.39 billion as it narrows its net loss from $6.75 billion to $5.37 billion. For 2024, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to grow 42% to $6.26 billion as it narrows its net loss again to $4.34 billion.
Based on those estimates, Rivian's stock might seem cheap at 3 times this year's sales. By comparison, the market leader Tesla -- which is a lot larger but growing at a much slower rate -- trades at 8 times this year's sales. Yet there's a key difference: Tesla is firmly profitable, but there's no guarantee Rivian will ever break even.
Rivian ended the third quarter of 2023 with $9.13 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Including its revolving credit facility, it had a total liquidity of $10.25 billion -- so it won't go bankrupt anytime soon. It had $5.9 billion in total liabilities at the end of the quarter, which gave it a fairly manageable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6. Tesla ended its latest quarter with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7.
But in mid-November, Rivian announced plans to borrow as much as $15 billion to fund the construction of its second manufacturing plant in Georgia. Therefore, Rivian's leverage will probably rise significantly throughout 2024.
On the bright side, Rivian's gross margin has been improving as it ramps up the production of its Enduro drive units. It ended the third quarter of 2023 with a negative gross margin of 36%, compared to negative 171% a year earlier. It still has a long way to go before it achieves break-even gross margin, but the planned opening of its Georgia plant -- which will roughly triple its annual production capacity to 600,000 vehicles -- should dilute its production costs over the long term.
Is Rivian the right EV stock buy for 2024?
Rivian is in better shape than a lot of the smaller EV makers, but its stock should remain under pressure until it meaningfully ramps up its production, stabilizes its gross margin, and narrows its net losses. I believe Rivian could still be a good long-term investment, but I'd rather wait to see its full earnings report in February before buying the stock.

Yahoo Finance Plus · Screeners · Personal Finance · Crypto · Sectors  · Contact Us...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-trucks-dominate-while-suv-172826380.html,"Ford Motor Co. continues to dominate the lucrative full-size truck market in the U.S. while at the same time slipping in SUV sales, a segment directly affected by a recall involving rear cameras on the popular Explorer that triggered a stop sale.
F-Series truck sales released Thursday remained strong despite the UAW strike that targeted the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville that builds the Super Duty.
In the fourth quarter alone, Ford sales grew 0.8% over the same period last year with 487,840 vehicles. For all of 2023, Ford saw its sales in the U.S. climb 7.1% from a year earlier to nearly 2 million vehicles. Overall, Ford's sale of 1,995,912 vehicles was the best since 2020. Data indicates the post-pandemic recovery is here.
A 2023 Ford Super Duty F-250 Tremor Off-Road Package.
General Motors had a 14% increase for the year with 2.6 million vehicles sold, the company reported Wednesday. Stellantis reported the same day that its sales in the U.S. dropped 1% to 1,527,090 vehicles in 2023.
Ford EV performance
The Dearborn automaker touted these sales highlights:
A record year for electric sales, up 18% with 72,608 vehicles from a year ago. In the fourth quarter alone, Ford sold 25,937 EVs.
Mustang Mach-E sales rose 3% in 2023 with 40,771 vehicles sold and the best year since launching in 2021.
Ford’s E-Transit remained America’s bestselling electric van in 2023 with sales of 7,672 vehicles up 18% over 2022.
Ford held the No. 2 EV sales position in the U.S. behind Tesla.
Ford truck performance for the year
Ford held its top spot as top truck seller in gas-powered, hybrid and electric trucks with 1,081,777 trucks and vans in 2023, up 13%.
In 2023, F-Series grew 15% to 750,789 customers, outselling second place Chevrolet Silverado by about 200,000 trucks.
Gas- and diesel-powered F-Series sales of 676,521 trucks climbed 12% while top selling F-150 Lightning grew with 24,165 vehicles or 55% and F-150 hybrid grew with 50,103 vehicles or 41%. No Ford competitor offers all three powertrain categories.
The Ford Transit van saw sales spike 21% to 190,016 vans in 2023 to dominate commercial van sales.
“In a year of challenges, from a labor strike to supply issues, our amazing lineup of gas, electric and hybrid vehicles and our fantastic dealers delivered solid growth and momentum. We have the products that customers want,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a news release. “I am especially proud Ford remained the No. 2 EV brand in America and our next-gen, digitally advanced new EVs are on the way. Now we are spring-loaded for 2024 with new versions coming of our most popular trucks and SUVs, a full year of new Super Duty and Mustang, and a big year for Lincoln.”
Hybrid trucks remain key to strategy, revenue
Growing sales of hybrid trucks is essential to attracting new customers because, Farley has said, many buyers aren't ready to pivot completely to all-electric vehicles. In this area, which Ford dominates with trucks, Ford is seeing growth.
Ford hybrid sales jumped 55% in the fourth quarter to 37,229 vehicles sold, with a 25% growth or 133,743 vehicles for all of 2023.
Maverick hybrid played an important role with sales of 52,361 trucks or a 67% increase for the year. Hybrid comes as a standard option in Maverick, which is also available as a gas-only powered vehicle, with more than half the sales being hybrids. Maverick sales overall were up 26.5% as customers continued to wait for orders to be filled.
F-150 hybrid shot up 41% with 2023 sales of 50,103.
""We saw strong gains coming from gas-powered vehicles and record setting sales for our hybrid and electric vehicles,” Andrew Frick, president, Ford Blue, said in the news release. “None of our competitors offer the powertrain choices that Ford has become known for in trucks. And it will continue with the launch of the new F-150 later this month.”
Erich Merkle, Ford U.S. sales analyst, told the Free Press that the hybrid strategy has put Ford so far ahead of its competitors because the automaker has established a solid, growing customer base.
""The only truck that beat the F-150 hybrid was the Maverick hybrid,"" he said. ""We found this big opportunity with customers by offering a broad range of trucks.""
Who is gaining, losing vehicle market share
The industry saw ups and downs with market share in the U.S. in 2023, according to Motor Intelligence data obtained by the Detroit Free Press:
GM 16.5%, up from 16.2%
Toyota 14.4%, down from 15.2%
Ford had 12.7%, down from 13.3%
Stellantis 9.8%, down from 11.2%
Honda 8.4%, up from 7.1%
Nissan 5.8%, up from 5.2%
Tesla 4.2%, up from 3.8%
Hyundai, no change at 5.6%
Kia, no change at 5%
Volkswagen, no change at 3.6%
What analysts are saying
The Explorer recall, coupled with exiting the Ecosport line, took a lot of sales volume off the books for Ford.
If not for the Explorer recall and the strike, which also hit production of the Ford Bronco at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, ""Ford would have put in even stronger numbers,"" said veteran analyst John McElroy, host of the ""Autoline After Hours"" podcast and webcast.
Explorer sales dropped 10% for the year to 186,799. Bronco sales dropped 9.7% to 105,665. Ford Ranger, which is built at the same plant as the Bronco, had sales plummet 43% to 32,334.
Yet Bronco Sport, which is built in Mexico, jumped 28% to 127,476 vehicles. Escape grew 2.6% with 140,968 vehicles. Edge grew 24% with 106,098 and Expedition grew 18% with 73,396. The classic Ford Mustang grew 2.2% to 48,605.
Meanwhile, the Lincoln Nautilus had a 17.9% gain with 24,334 and Navigator surged with a 32.9% gain on 17,549 vehicles. Corsair and Aviator had double-digit losses. Lincoln sales dipped 2% to 81,818 in 2023 despite an 8.8% gain in the final three months of the year with 22,377 vehicles sold.
Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told the Free Press that Ford closed December stronger than expected. ""Lincoln finally showed some signs of life with sales up.""
Ford earned praise for its truck strategy from Joe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions. He specifically cited dialing back on Lightning production until the pace of sales picks up. He looked with caution at automakers focused on an all battery electric vehicle lineup.
""We like the fact that they're staying ahead,"" McCabe said. ""Maybe an all BEV strategy is not the proper strategy at this time. You can't cannibalize your biggest moneymakers pushing a new tech on people. The fact that Ford is balancing its portfolio with ICE, hybrids and EVs is the right play.""

Tech Stocks Log Four-Day Losing Streak, Bonds Rise: Markets Wrap
Funds operated by Wood’s firm Ark Investment Management LLC have bought about 216,000 shares of the company over investments made on Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, according to Ark’s daily trading data compiled by Bloomberg. Before the current buying streak, Ark had largely sold shares in the EV maker for three straight quarters.
Analysts’ overall view on Tesla is fast deteriorating as an EV slowdown looms, government incentives are drying up and Chinese rival BYD Co.’s cheaper models are threatening its leadership position in electric cars. Tesla shares fell 4% to close at $238.45 on Wednesday.
The 12-month forward consensus profit estimate for Tesla has dropped more than 20% over the past year compared to a rise of 6% in the same metric for the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The EV maker’s consensus analyst rating is near its lowest score in almost two years.
While the industry’s growth is expected to slow down and China’s is on track to become the world’s largest passenger car exporter, Wood believes Tesla is primed to grab more market share as peers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. step back from their EV plans due to profitability concerns.
“There is more share for Tesla and others who choose to go for it,” Wood said on Bloomberg TV last week.
Ark’s analysis of Tesla yields a price estimate of $2,000 per share in 2027, while its bull and bear cases come in at $2,500 and $1,400 per share, respectively, the investment management firm reiterated in a year-ender email to its subscribers. Ark’s flagship fund has risen 59% over the last 12 months compared to a gain of 51% for the Nasdaq 100 Index.
