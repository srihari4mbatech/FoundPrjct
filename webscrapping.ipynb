      "Third Quarter 2023 Overview\n",
      "In the third quarter 2023, earnings and cash flow grew despite a decline in revenue, evidencing an ability to manage profitability amid fluctuations in revenue through strategic initiatives, cost efficiency actions and productivity. The decline in revenue for the third quarter 2023 reflects declines in certain cyclical, low margin post-sale revenue categories, as well as declines in revenue associated with strategic actions put in place to simplify our business, partially offset by a stable demand for our products and services.\n",
      "Equipment sales of $386 million in the third quarter 2023 declined 1.0% in actual currency, or 2.1% in constant currency1, primarily due to the prior year reduction in backlog2. Consistent with recent quarters, revenue trends outpaced equipment installation activity, due to favorable product and geographic mix, as well as higher prices. This was particularly true with our A3 products, which experienced unfavorable geographic mix effects in the prior year due to backlog2 reductions in EMEA. Entry A4 installations were lower again this quarter, due to the ongoing normalization of work from home trends. Post sale revenue of $1,266 million declined 7.0% in actual currency or 9.0% in constant currency1. Post sale declines were primarily driven by reductions in cyclical transactional items, most notably a significant decline in lower-margin paper sales and IT endpoint devices. Post sale revenue was further impacted by the termination of Fuji royalty income and specific strategic actions, resulting in lower financing and PARC revenue.\n",
      "Pre-tax income increased year-over-year primarily due to the Goodwill impairment charge in the prior year period and lower RD&E expenses, Other expenses, net and Restructuring and related costs, net. Adjusted1 operating income was up slightly year-over-year as the effects of lower revenue and gross profit, along with higher incentive compensation and bad debt expenses, were offset by ongoing operating efficiencies and pricing actions.\n",
      "Total Revenue is expected to be flat to down low-single-digits in constant currency1 for the full-year 2023. There continues to be momentum in demand for our products and services in the Americas, particularly for our faster-growing Digital Services. However, during third quarter 2023 there has been a mild softening of demand in our European markets, reflecting weaker macroeconomic conditions. As a result, revenue is expected to come in at the lower end of the expected range. The Company expects a difficult equipment sales revenue comparison in the fourth quarter 2023 due to the significant prior year reduction in backlog2. Further, the headwinds affecting post sale revenue in third quarter 2023 are expected to persist in fourth quarter 2023. Adjusted1 operating income margin continues to be in the expected range of 5.5% to 6.0% for full-year 2023, due to the successful implementation of ongoing cost efficiency programs and a focus on generating profitable revenue. We also expect free cash flow1 for full-year 2023 to be at least $600 million.\n",

      "(2) Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates.

These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, delays or disruptions in the global supply chain, higher interest rates, and wars and other conflicts, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to succeed in a competitive environment, including by developing new products and service offerings and preserving our existing products and market share as well as repositioning our business in the face of customer preference, technological, and other change, such as evolving return-to-office and hybrid working trends; failure of our customers, vendors, and logistics partners to perform their contractual obligations to us; our ability to attract, train, and retain key personnel; execution risks around our Reinvention; the risk of breaches of our security systems due to cyber, malware, or other intentional attacks that could expose us to liability, litigation, regulatory action or damage our reputation; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve our cost structure; changes in economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, and tax laws in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; interest rates, cost of borrowing, and access to credit markets; risks related to our indebtedness; the imposition of new or incremental trade protection measures such as tariffs and import or export restrictions; funding requirements associated with our employee pension and retiree health benefit plans; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the risk that our operations and products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives and anti-corruption laws; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; laws, regulations, international agreements and other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change, as well as the physical effects of climate change; and other factors as set forth from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.\n",
      "However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n",
      "Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below, as well as in the third quarter 2023 presentation slides available at www.xerox.com/investor.\n",
      "Adjusted Earnings Measures\n",
      "Adjusted Net Income and Earnings per share (EPS)\n",
      "Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\n",
      "The above measures were adjusted for the following items:\n",
      "Restructuring and related costs, net: Restructuring and related costs, net include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our transformation programs beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our transformation programs are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance.\n",
      "Amortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\n",
      "Non-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the service cost elements of our retirement costs, which is related to current employee service as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.\n",
      "Discrete, unusual or infrequent items: We exclude these item(s), when applicable, given their discrete, unusual or infrequent nature and their impact on the comparability of our results for the period to prior periods and future expected trends:\n",
      "Goodwill impairment\n",
      "Tax Indemnification - Conduent\n",
      "Adjusted Operating Income and Margin\n",
      "We calculate and utilize adjusted operating income (loss) and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax income (loss) and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted as adjustments for our adjusted earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.\n",
      "Constant Currency (CC)\n",
      "To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as \"constant currency.\" This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.\n",
      "Free Cash Flow\n",
      "To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust operating cash flows by subtracting amounts related to capital expenditures. Management believes this measure gives investors an additional perspective on cash flow from operating activities in excess of amounts required for reinvestment. It provides a measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase.\n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has agreed to settle a $5 billion privacy lawsuit alleging that it spied on people who used the “incognito” mode in its Chrome browser — along with similar “private” modes in other browsers — to track their internet use.\n",
      "The class-action lawsuit filed in 2020 said Google misled users into believing that it wouldn’t track their internet activities while using incognito mode. It argued that Google's advertising technologies and other techniques continued to catalog details of users' site visits and activities despite their use of supposedly “private” browsing.\n",
      "Plaintiffs also charged that Google's activities yielded an “unaccountable trove of information” about users who thought they'd taken steps to protect their privacy.\n",
      "The settlement, reached Thursday, must still be approved by a federal judge. Terms weren’t disclosed, but the suit originally sought $5 billion on behalf of users; lawyers for the plaintiffs said they expect to present the court with a final settlement agreement by Feb. 24.\n",

      "Dec 29 (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former fixer and lawyer, said in court papers unsealed on Friday that he mistakenly gave his attorney fake case citations generated by an artificial intelligence program that made their way into an official court filing.\n",
      "Cohen, who is expected to be a star witness against Trump at one of the former president's criminal trials, said in a sworn declaration in federal court in Manhattan that he did not realize the citations generated by Google Bard were fictitious.\n",
      "Google Bard is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Alphabet Inc's Google. The case citations were included by an attorney for Cohen in a motion seeking an early end to his supervised release following Cohen's imprisonment for campaign finance violations.\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman earlier this month said three court decisions cited in the motion did not exist. He directed Cohen's lawyer, David Schwartz, to demonstrate why he should not be sanctioned for citing non-existent cases.\n",
      "Cohen, who was disbarred nearly five years ago, in Friday's filings said those citations came from his own online research and that he had not expected Schwartz to \"drop the cases wholesale into his submission without even confirming they existed.\"\n",
      "Cohen said he had \"not kept up with emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.\"\n",
      "\"I deeply regret any problems Mr. Schwartz's filing may have caused,\" Cohen said in the filing.\n",
      "Furman in an order on Friday gave Scwhartz and prosecutors until Wednesday to respond to Cohen's filing. A spokesperson for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams declined to comment. Schwartz's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

      "A group of seven megacap technology companies, known as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" played a central role in driving a nice surge in technology stocks in 2023, which is evident from the 66% jump in the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index during the year.\n",
      "The Magnificent Seven group comprises Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These tech titans delivered healthy gains to investors in 2023.\n",
      "For instance, shares of Alphabet have jumped 61% during the year. In this article, we will take a closer look at the reasons why Alphabet's robust rally is set to continue not just in 2024 but also in the long run.\n",
      "AI can help accelerate Alphabet's growth\n",
      "Alphabet stock's jump in 2023 can be attributed to the company's improving financial performance, driven by gains in its advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's revenue increased 11% year over year to $76.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Its diluted earnings jumped an impressive 46% year over year to $1.55 per share.\n",
      "The good part is that Alphabet's financial performance improved every quarter in 2023. Its revenue was up just 3% year over year in Q1, followed by a 9% jump in Q2. Analysts are expecting Alphabet to finish the year with $306 billion in revenue, which would be an 8% increase over 2022.\n",
      "GOOG Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n",
      "More importantly, as the chart above indicates, Alphabet's growth rate is anticipated to get better in 2024 and 2025. This potential acceleration in Alphabet's growth can be attributed to the secular opportunities the company is sitting on, such as an uptick in digital ad spending and the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that could positively impact the company's search and cloud businesses.\n",
      "For example, global digital ad spending is estimated to jump 11% in 2024 to $696 billion, which is in line with the growth this space clocked in 2023. Alphabet is looking to capitalize on this massive market opportunity by giving advertisers AI-powered tools so that they can improve audience targeting and generate stronger returns on the ad dollars they spend.\n",
      "Alphabet's Performance Max platform allows advertisers to create AI-powered ad campaigns, and the company points out that those who have adopted this platform have witnessed an 18% increase in average conversion rates. Additionally, Alphabet management points out that almost 80% of its advertisers \"use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product.\"\n",
      "As such, Alphabet has positioned itself to make the most of the growing adoption of AI within the digital ad market, which is expected to generate $107 billion in annual revenue in 2028 as compared to just under $16 billion in 2021.\n",
      "On the other hand, Alphabet's Google Cloud business is also getting a nice boost thanks to AI. The company's Google Cloud revenue increased 22% year over year in the third quarter to $8.4 billion. That's not surprising, as Google is offering multiple AI products in the cloud, which allow customers to build generative AI applications, gain insights from unstructured data with the help of AI, and train machine learning models, among other things.\n",
      "More importantly, the company has landed multiple customers for its AI-fueled cloud services already. This trend is likely to continue as the size of the cloud AI market is expected to hit a whopping $887 billion in 2032 as compared to just $43 billion last year. So, Alphabet is on track to benefit from massive markets where AI adoption is gaining steam, which is why it won't be surprising to see the stock delivering more upside in 2024, as well as in the long run.\n",
      "More reasons to buy the stock right now\n",
      "We have already seen that Alphabet is predicted to deliver stronger revenue growth this year. What's more, analysts are forecasting its earnings to grow at a healthy pace as well, following this year's estimated jump of 26% to $5.77 per share.\n",
      "GOOG EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n",
      "Alphabet has a five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.4. Multiplying that with the company's projected 2024 earnings of $6.70 per share points toward a stock price of $183, which would be a jump of 28% from current levels. Another year of robust bottom-line growth in 2025 means that this AI stock is built for even more upside in the long run.\n",
      "At the same time, investors should note that Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven group.\n",
      "AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n",
      "So, investors are getting a good deal on this tech titan right now, even after the impressive gains it has delivered in 2023. What's more, Alphabet stock could deliver even stronger gains in the New Year if the market decides to reward it with higher earnings multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth, giving investors another reason to buy it before it soars further.\n",

      "JULIE HYMAN: The combined market cap of US companies valued over $1 trillion hit 10 trillion in 2023, doubling valuations from last year. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre is here to dig into what happened there. Hi Jared.\n",
      "JARED BLIKRE: Hi Julie. Mag Seven has played out. So we're going to talk about the five. And that doesn't include Meta and Tesla. But this is just fine for analysis here. $1 trillion club. Top of that is Apple with just over $3 trillion worth of market capitalization. You can see that in this yellow slice right here.\n",
      "By the way, the rest of the market, the S&P 495, that takes up 75% of the market. So we're talking about 25% concentration by the five top issues. This goes down Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA. The latest entrance to the trillion dollar club, that's up to $1.231 trillion in market cap, and that's the biggest gainer this year. About 240% in the S&P 500.\n",
      "And I've charted these five stocks along with the rest of the 495 all the way back to 2019. So you can see what happened over the pandemic. And by the way, just notice this scale starts at $15 trillion. So zero is actually down here. And again, about 25% of the market are these five stocks here.\n",
      "But I was running a P/E analysis actually on the Mag Seven. I didn't have it for these top five, but it's a rough estimate. We're looking at a P/E of about 35 right now. And just before the pandemic, it was actually much higher. It was up 55-- or excuse me, at 50. And then just after the pandemic, it was 55. Regardless of how you slice it here, these stocks are a little bit less expensive than they used to be. So their earnings have caught up here.\n",
      "Just want to talk about some of the other stocks here, the 495, and some of their industry groups that have really come alive over the last 43 days. That's since October 27th. The early last-- early part of the year, that was a Magnificent Seven. But you take a look at the top line here, over the past six weeks, ARKK up 54%. Then you've got Bitcoin, that's Grayscale, up 38%. Homebuilders, regional banks, solar, IPOs, chip stocks, internet stocks all up more than 25%. So been a pretty big year there.\n",
      "- Yeah, Jared. It's interesting to see some of the names that had struggled earlier in the year, really picking up steam as we head to the year-end and investors seek to get a little bit more juice here. Jared, thank you so much. We really appreciate it.\n"
